# Calendar Connectors: API contract

Status: parts 1 to 10 describe the code on `master` once Phase 3 (write capabilities) has merged; part 11 lists the known gaps.
The library is pre-1.0 and lives in this repository; it is meant to be extracted into its own repository once a
second provider (Microsoft, Phase 4) has proved the API is provider-neutral. Until then, anything here can change
with a matching change to this document.

## 1. What the suite is

A portable Swift library that lets a host application read (and, from Phase 3, write) calendars from several
providers behind one model, plus the small amount of host-specific glue TimeTug needs.

| Package / target | Role | Depends on | Platform notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CalendarConnectors` / `CalendarCore` | Model, source and connector protocols, stores, HTTP seam, change polling, all-day helpers | Foundation only | Portable; built on Linux in CI |
| `CalendarConnectors` / `CalendarOAuth` | OAuth 2.0 authorization-code + PKCE client, access-token cache | `CalendarCore` | Portable; no crypto dependency (pure-Swift SHA-256 default) |
| `CalendarConnectors` / `GoogleCalendar` | Google Calendar connector (REST v3) | `CalendarCore`, `CalendarOAuth` | Portable |
| `CalendarConnectors` / `CalendarTestSupport` | Fakes and conformance helpers for connector tests | `CalendarCore` | Test-only product |
| `CalendarApple` | Apple-only adapters: Keychain credentials, loopback and web-auth-session OAuth interaction, CryptoKit hashing | `CalendarCore`, `CalendarOAuth` | macOS |
| `EventKitSource` | Apple Calendar via EventKit as a connector | `CalendarCore` | macOS |
| `CalendarBridge` | Adapts a library source to TimeTug Core's own `CalendarSource` | `CalendarCore`, `TimeTugCore` | TimeTug only |

Layering rule: maximise generic, cross-platform code in `CalendarConnectors`. Anything OS-specific (Keychain,
Network.framework, EventKit, AuthenticationServices) lives in a separate adapter that implements a library
protocol, so another host can supply its own.

Dependency direction: `GoogleCalendar` → `CalendarOAuth` → `CalendarCore`; adapters and the bridge depend on
`CalendarCore`; nothing in `CalendarConnectors` depends on an adapter.

## 2. Conventions every part of the contract relies on

- **Concurrency.** All public types are `Sendable`; sources and stores are safe to call from any task. Swift 6
  language mode (the Apple adapters build in Swift 5 mode because of AppKit/Network types).
- **Errors.** Sources throw `SourceError` (part 3.6) and never leak provider or transport types. Cancellation
  surfaces as `CancellationError`.
- **Time.** Instants are `Date`. A timed event's `timeZone` is the zone it was authored in (informational for
  timed events).
- **All-day events (canonical form).** `isAllDay == true` ⇒ `timeZone` is non-nil, `start` is midnight of the
  first day in that zone, `end` is midnight of the day after the last day (exclusive). Days are interpreted in the
  event's own zone, not the device's. Connectors build and read this form only through the `AllDay` helpers, and
  their tests run fixtures through `AllDayConformance.violations`.
- **Identity.** A calendar is identified by `CalendarDescriptor.id` within its source. An event is identified by
  `(calendarID, eventID)` within its source (`CalendarEvent.id == "\(calendarID)/\(eventID)"`). A source is
  identified by `CalendarSource.id`. For network connectors `id == Connection.sourceID == "<kindID>-<connectionID>"`.
  EventKit is the documented exception: its source id is the constant `"eventkit"`, kept so previously stored
  calendar keys stay valid. Hosts always identify a source by `source.id`.
- **Secrets never live in the library.** Non-secret account data is a `Connection`; secrets go through a
  host-supplied `CredentialStore`. OAuth client identifiers are injected by the host from configuration that is
  not committed.
- **Polling, not push.** Change detection uses provider sync tokens on a timer. There are no webhooks or relay
  servers in the contract (the `supportsPush` capability is a seam only).

## 3. `CalendarCore`

### 3.1 Model

```swift
public struct CalendarDescriptor: Hashable, Sendable, Identifiable {
    var id: String; var title: String
    private(set) var colorHex: String?   // "#RRGGBB" uppercase, or nil if unknown/invalid
    var accessRole: AccessRole           // owner, writer, reader, freeBusyReader
    var isPrimary: Bool; var timeZone: TimeZone?
    var accountName: String?             // the owning account, e.g. the signed-in email
    var kind: CalendarKind               // standard, subscribed, birthdays
    static func normalizedHex(_:) -> String?   // "#RGB" | "#RRGGBB" | "RRGGBB" → "#RRGGBB"
}
```

`CalendarEvent` (the one generic event type; TimeTug's own wrapper is `TimeTugCalendarEvent`):

| Field | Type | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `eventID` | `String` | Unique within its calendar; a recurring instance has its own id (see part 11 for EventKit) |
| `id` | `String` (computed) | `"\(calendarID)/\(eventID)"`, unique within a source |
| `uid` | `String?` | iCalendar UID (Google `iCalUID`); stable across copies of the same meeting |
| `calendarID` | `String` | Owning calendar |
| `title` | `String` | Non-optional; a connector substitutes its own placeholder for an untitled event ("(No title)" today) |
| `notes`, `location` | `String?` | |
| `start`, `end` | `Date` | See the all-day convention; `end` is exclusive |
| `timeZone` | `TimeZone?` | Non-nil whenever `isAllDay` |
| `isAllDay` | `Bool` | |
| `status` | `EventStatus` | `confirmed`, `tentative`, `cancelled` |
| `availability` | `Availability` | `busy`, `free` |
| `visibility` | `Visibility` | `default`, `publicEvent`, `privateEvent`, `confidential` |
| `kind` | `EventKind` | `standard`, `focusTime`, `outOfOffice`, `workingLocation`, `birthday`, `other` |
| `seriesID`, `originalStart` | `String?`, `Date?` | Set on an instance of a recurring series (Google `recurringEventId` and `originalStartTime`; EventKit `eventIdentifier` and `occurrenceDate`, for events that recur or are detached occurrences) |
| `attendees` | `[Attendee]` | `name?`, `email?` (trimmed, lowercased), `role` (`required/optional/resource`), `response`, `isSelf`, `isOrganizer` |
| `organizer` | `Attendee?` | |
| `conference` | `ConferenceInfo?` | `url` + `provider` (`meet/teams/zoom/other`) |
| `reminders` | `[Reminder]` | `minutesBefore`; empty means none *or* provider defaults (not distinguished today) |
| `url` | `URL?` | Link to the event in the provider's UI |
| `version` | `String?` | Opaque provider version (Google etag, EventKit `lastModifiedDate` as a fractional-epoch string); the base of optimistic writes (part 10) |
| `myResponse` | `ResponseStatus?` | The account owner's own response, when the provider says |
| `sourceID` | `String?` | The source that produced the event (`Connection.sourceID`; `"eventkit"` for EventKit); lets a host route an event to its account. Does not change `id` |

Reads return recurring events already expanded into instances. No read path returns a recurrence rule.

### 3.2 Sources

```swift
public protocol CalendarSource: Sendable {
    var id: String { get }
    var displayName: String { get }
    var capabilities: SourceCapabilities { get }
    func calendars() async throws -> [CalendarDescriptor]
    /// Events of every visible calendar of the account that overlap `interval`.
    func events(in interval: DateInterval) async throws -> [CalendarEvent]
    func changes() -> AsyncStream<CalendarChange>
}

public protocol PollingCalendarSource: CalendarSource {
    /// One cheap incremental check. Returns the change since the last call, or nil for none.
    /// The first call establishes the baseline and returns nil.
    func checkForChanges() async throws -> CalendarChange?
}
```

Guarantees:

- `events(in:)` returns events sorted by start (then id) for network connectors, excluding calendars the account
  can no longer read. Cancelled events may be present in the model (`status == .cancelled`); consumers such as the
  bridge drop them.
- A source is read-only unless it also conforms to `WritableCalendarSource` (part 10).

### 3.3 Capabilities

```swift
public struct SourceCapabilities: Equatable, Sendable {
    var canWrite: Bool              // by convention true exactly when the source conforms to WritableCalendarSource
    var canEditAttendees: Bool      // true exactly when writableFields contains .attendees (checked by the conformance suite)
    var canRespondToInvite: Bool
    var providesConference: Bool
    var syncKind: SyncKind          // .none, .token, .notification
    var supportsPush: Bool
    var writableFields: Set<EventField>          // what create/update can write; empty when read-only
    var controlsNotifications: Bool              // honors NotifyPolicy; false = the server decides
    var recurrenceScopes: Set<RecurrenceScope>   // scopes accepted on a series; empty when read-only
}
```

Capabilities are what a source *can* do, declared per connector; the per-calendar `accessRole` says which of its
calendars are writable. The three write fields default to the read-only value. Current values:

| | `canWrite` | `canEditAttendees` | `canRespondToInvite` | `providesConference` | `syncKind` | `writableFields` | `controlsNotifications` | `recurrenceScopes` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Google | true | true | true | true | `.token` | all | true | all three |
| EventKit | true | false | false | false | `.notification` | title, notes, location, timing, availability, reminders, recurrence | false | all three (subject to the EventKit spike, part 11) |

### 3.4 Changes

```swift
public enum CalendarChange: Equatable, Sendable {
    case calendarsChanged                      // reload calendars AND events; event changes in the same check are not reported separately
    case eventsChanged(calendarIDs: Set<String>?)   // nil = scope unknown
    case sourceFailed(SourceError)             // terminal: the stream finishes after this (e.g. .authExpired)
}
```

`ChangeMonitor` (public struct) turns a `PollingCalendarSource.checkForChanges()` into `changes()`:
default interval 60 s, exponential backoff on failures capped at 900 s, sleeping through an injectable `Sleeper`.
Polling starts when the stream is created and stops when the consuming task is cancelled or the stream finishes;
dropping the stream without cancelling does not stop it. Use one subscriber per source.

### 3.5 Connecting

```swift
public struct Connection: Codable, Hashable, Sendable, Identifiable {
    var kindID: String; var connectionID: ConnectionID   // ConnectionID = String
    var displayName: String; var config: [String: String] // non-secret
    var sourceID: String { "\(kindID)-\(connectionID)" }  // every consumer must use this helper
}

public protocol ConnectorKind: Sendable {                 // registered once per provider
    var id: String { get }; var displayName: String { get }
    var supportedPlatforms: Platform { get }              // OptionSet: macOS, iOS, linux, windows
    var authorization: AuthorizationMethod { get }        // .oauth, .password(fields:), .system
    func authorize(using: any AuthorizationInteraction, credentials: any CredentialStore) async throws -> Connection
    func reauthorize(_: Connection, using: any AuthorizationInteraction, credentials: any CredentialStore) async throws -> Connection
    func makeSource(for: Connection, credentials: any CredentialStore, syncState: any SyncStateStore) throws -> any CalendarSource
}
```

- `authorize` stores secrets only after sign-in fully succeeds, under a fresh `ConnectionID`; a failure leaves
  nothing stored.
- `reauthorize` keeps the `connectionID` (so `sourceID`, calendar keys and sync state stay valid), replaces the
  secrets, and throws `SourceError.invalidResponse` if the user signs in as a different account.
- `ConnectorRegistry` (`register`, `kind(id:)`, `kinds(for: Platform)` sorted by id) is the host's lookup.

Host-supplied seams:

```swift
public protocol CredentialStore: Sendable {   // keyed secrets per connection (Google: ["refresh_token": …])
    func secrets(for:) async throws -> [String: String]?
    func setSecrets(_:for:) async throws
    func removeSecrets(for:) async throws
}
public protocol SyncStateStore: Sendable {    // per-connection, per-scope tokens; absent = full sync
    func token(for:scope:) async -> String?
    func setToken(_:for:scope:) async
    func removeAll(for:) async
}
public protocol AuthorizationInteraction: Sendable {   // the only OS/UI-specific part of sign-in
    func beginOAuthRedirect() async throws -> any OAuthRedirectSession
    func promptCredentials(_ fields: [CredentialField]) async throws -> [String: String]
}
public protocol OAuthRedirectSession: Sendable {
    var redirectURI: URL { get }
    func authorize(at authorizationURL: URL) async throws -> URL   // opens the URL, waits, returns the redirect
    func close() async
}
```

Shipped implementations in `CalendarCore`: `InMemoryCredentialStore`, `InMemorySyncStateStore` (actors),
`FileConnectionStore` (JSON list of `Connection`; a missing file loads as empty, an unreadable file is never
overwritten and throws `FileStoreError.unreadable` on write), `FileSyncStateStore` (one JSON file; unreadable ⇒
"no tokens", so sources re-bootstrap).

### 3.6 Errors

```swift
public enum SourceError: Error, Sendable, Equatable {
    case authExpired                    // re-authorize
    case network(String)
    case rateLimited(retryAfter: TimeInterval?)
    case server(status: Int)
    case invalidResponse(String)
    case needsPermission                // OS/user has not granted access to a local store; never thrown by network connectors
}
```

Provider-specific outcomes (404, 410, per-calendar 403) are handled inside the connector and never escape as
provider types. Write methods additionally throw `WriteError` (part 10); authentication, network, rate-limit and server
failures on a write are still `SourceError`.

### 3.7 HTTP seam

`HTTPTransport.send(_:)` returns any HTTP response including 4xx/5xx and throws `SourceError.network` for
transport failures. `URLSessionTransport` is the default (`FoundationNetworking` on Linux); tests use
`FakeTransport`. `HTTPRequest` and `HTTPResponse` are plain value types (response header names are lowercased).

### 3.8 All-day helpers

`CalendarDate` (`year, month, day`, `adding(days:)`, `Comparable`) and `AllDay` (`startOfDay`, `date(of:in:)`,
`canonical(first:endExclusive:in:)`, `dates(start:end:in:)`, `endExclusive(afterLast:)`) are the only sanctioned way
to convert between provider all-day dates and the canonical instants.

## 4. `CalendarOAuth`

- `OAuthConfig`: authorization and token endpoints, client id, optional client secret (a desktop client's secret is
  not confidential but the token endpoint still requires it), scopes, extra authorization parameters.
- `OAuthClient(config:transport:now:)`: `authorizationURL(redirectURI:state:codeChallenge:)` (always PKCE `S256`),
  `authorizationCode(from:expectedState:)` (throws `AuthorizationError.stateMismatch`, `.cancelled` for
  `access_denied`, `.missingCode`), `exchange(code:verifier:redirectURI:)`, and `refresh(refreshToken:)`, which
  throws `SourceError.authExpired` on `invalid_grant`.
- `AccessTokenProvider` (actor): `accessToken()` returns a cached token or refreshes 60 s before expiry; concurrent
  callers share one in-flight refresh; a rotated refresh token is written back to the `CredentialStore` (re-reading
  first so other keys are not overwritten); `invalidate()` after a 401.
- `PKCE`: verifier generation and `challenge(for:hasher:)`. `SHA256Hashing` is a one-method protocol; the library
  ships `PureSwiftSHA256` (NIST-vector tested, used only on a public verifier) so `CalendarCore` and its dependents
  need no crypto package; hosts may inject `CryptoKitSHA256` (from `CalendarApple`) or their own.

## 5. `GoogleCalendar`

Public surface: `GoogleOAuthConfig(clientID:clientSecret:)`, `GoogleConnectorKind(config:transport:now:sleep:pollInterval:hasher:)`,
and the `CalendarSource` returned by `makeSource` (id `google-<connectionID>`).

- **Kind:** id `google`, display name "Google", all platforms, `.oauth`. Scopes
  `calendar.events` and `calendar.calendarlist.readonly` (the events scope already covers writes, so no
  re-consent is needed; it cannot create calendars). Authorization requests `access_type=offline` and `prompt=consent` so a refresh token is issued.
- **Connection:** `displayName` and `config["email"]` are the primary calendar's id (lowercased); sign-in throws
  `invalidResponse` if no refresh token or no primary calendar comes back.
- **Reads:** `calendarList` (paged, `showHidden=false`, `minAccessRole=freeBusyReader`), then per calendar
  `events.list` with `singleEvents=true`, the requested window, paging and a restricted `fields` mask. All-day `date`
  values are converted to the canonical form. A calendar that returns 404 or a plain `forbidden` 403 is skipped.
- **Change detection:** one sync token per calendar plus a token for the set of calendars. Google forbids combining a
  sync token with a time window, so a token is bootstrapped from one minimal listing. A changed calendar set yields
  `.calendarsChanged`; changed events yield `.eventsChanged(calendarIDs:)`; HTTP 410 drops the token, re-bootstraps
  and reports a change.
- **HTTP behaviour:** 401 refreshes the token once, then `.authExpired`; 403 `insufficientPermissions` is
  `.authExpired`; 429 and rate-limit 403 retry up to three times honoring `Retry-After` (else jittered exponential
  backoff) and then throw `.rateLimited`; 5xx throws `.server`; anything else is `.invalidResponse`.
- **Writes:** `GoogleCalendarSource` conforms to `WritableCalendarSource` (part 10). Create, update (only the changed fields, `If-Match` from `ref.version`), delete and RSVP, with all three recurrence scopes; `.thisAndFollowing` truncates the master's `RRULE` and inserts a new series (two calls; see part 10 for the failure handling). Write requests use a write mode of the client: 412 is a stale version (handled by `PatchMerge`), 400 is `.invalid`, and a 403 with any reason but `insufficientPermissions` is `.forbidden`, except quota reasons, which are `SourceError.rateLimited`. Reads keep their original mapping.
- **Capabilities:** `canWrite`, `canEditAttendees`, `canRespondToInvite`, `providesConference`, `.token` sync, every field writable, `controlsNotifications`, all three scopes.

## 6. `CalendarApple` (macOS adapters)

| Type | Implements | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `KeychainCredentialStore(service:)` | `CredentialStore` | Secrets in the macOS Keychain |
| `LoopbackAuthorizationInteraction` | `AuthorizationInteraction` | OAuth through a 127.0.0.1 ephemeral-port listener; `openURL` and an optional `AuthorizationPresenting` are host-supplied; times out after 300 s; errors in `LoopbackError` |
| `WebAuthenticationSessionPresenter` | `AuthorizationPresenting` | Shows the sign-in page in an `ASWebAuthenticationSession` sheet that closes itself |
| `CryptoKitSHA256` | `SHA256Hashing` | Hardware-backed hashing for PKCE |

## 7. `EventKitSource`

- `EventKitSource` (`CalendarSource`, id `"eventkit"`, display name "Apple Calendar"): `requestAccess()` prompts for
  full calendar access; every read requires it and otherwise throws `.needsPermission`. Calendars map
  `allowsContentModifications` to `accessRole` `.writer` / `.reader` and EventKit's calendar types to `CalendarKind`.
  All-day events are normalised from EventKit's floating device-local dates to the canonical form in the device zone.
  `changes()` yields `.calendarsChanged` on every `EKEventStoreChanged`. `init(store:)` lets a host or test share an
  `EKEventStore`. Reads fill `version` (`lastModifiedDate`), `sourceID`, and, for events that recur or are detached
  occurrences, `seriesID` (the `eventIdentifier`) and `originalStart` (`occurrenceDate`).
- `EventKitConnectorKind` (`.system` authorization, macOS only): `authorize` requests access and returns the
  synthesised `Connection` (`kindID: "eventkit"`, `connectionID: "this-mac"`); hosts do not persist it, and
  `makeSource` returns the shared source.
- **Writes:** `EventKitSource` conforms to `WritableCalendarSource` (part 10). Create, update and delete with all three scopes (subject to the spike in part 11); `respond`, attendee changes, `visibility` and generated conferences throw `.unsupported`; a read-only calendar is `.forbidden`. Inputs are validated before the access check.
- Capabilities: no conference links, `.notification` sync, `canWrite`, `writableFields` = title, notes, location, timing, availability, reminders, recurrence, no attendee editing or RSVP, no notification control, all three scopes.

## 8. `CalendarBridge` (TimeTug only)

Core defines its own `CalendarSource` (`calendars() -> [CalendarInfo]`, `events(in:) -> [TimeTugCalendarEvent]`,
`changes() -> AsyncStream<Void>`) and never sees library types.

- `ConnectedSource` wraps any library source. It maps calendars to `CalendarInfo`, events to `TimeTugCalendarEvent`
  (dropping cancelled ones), forwards every library change (including `.sourceFailed`) as a `Void` yield, and translates
  `needsPermission` and `authExpired` to Core's `SourceError`. Cancelling the consumer cancels the inner stream.
- `TimeTugCalendarEvent { event, sourceID, conferenceURL, otherAttendeeCount, responseStatus, merge state… }` carries the
  library event as is. Its `id` also appends the start time, because recurring events share a source event id but
  differ in start.

## 9. Rules for implementing a connector

1. Conform to `CalendarSource`; add `PollingCalendarSource` and use `ChangeMonitor` when the provider has a cheap
   incremental check.
2. Throw only `SourceError` (and `WriteError` from write methods); map provider errors inside the module.
3. Emit canonical all-day events and run your mapper fixtures through `AllDayConformance`.
4. Set `id` to `Connection.sourceID` (unless a documented compatibility reason applies) and keep it stable across
   `reauthorize`.
5. Declare `capabilities` honestly; `calendars()` must set `accessRole` per calendar.
6. Keep secrets in the injected `CredentialStore` and persist nothing during a failed `authorize`.
7. Test against `FakeTransport` (network) or pure mappers (local stores); no test may need a real account.
8. To support writing, also conform to `WritableCalendarSource` (part 10), declare `writableFields`, `controlsNotifications` and `recurrenceScopes` honestly, throw `WriteError.unsupported` before changing anything for what you cannot write, and run `WritableSourceConformance` against a scratch calendar or a fake backend.

## 10. Write capabilities (Phase 3)

`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-calendar-connectors-phase3-design.md` is the design and rationale; this part is the
contract as built. The types live in `CalendarCore` (`Write/`), so they are portable.

**Opt-in.** Writing is an optional, separate protocol. A read-only connector never implements it.

```swift
public protocol WritableCalendarSource: CalendarSource {
    func create(_ draft: EventDraft, in calendarID: String, notify: NotifyPolicy) async throws -> CalendarEvent
    /// An empty patch writes nothing and returns the patch's `base`, or the current event when it has none.
    func update(_ ref: EventRef, _ patch: EventPatch, scope: RecurrenceScope, notify: NotifyPolicy) async throws -> CalendarEvent
    func delete(_ ref: EventRef, scope: RecurrenceScope, notify: NotifyPolicy) async throws
    /// `response` must be `.accepted`, `.tentative` or `.declined`.
    func respond(to ref: EventRef, _ response: ResponseStatus, scope: RecurrenceScope, notify: NotifyPolicy) async throws -> CalendarEvent
}
```

Writes return the event in the provider's resulting form, including its new `version`. A series-wide Google write returns
the master or first occurrence; callers that need instances re-read. `scope` is ignored for an event that is not part of a series.

**Three levels of "can I write?"**
1. Conformance to `WritableCalendarSource` (checked by callers with `as?`). Invariant: `capabilities.canWrite` is true
   exactly when the source conforms (a convention; `WritableSourceConformance` only checks that it is true on a writable source).
2. `capabilities` (part 3.3): `writableFields` (what create/update can write, including `.recurrence`),
   `controlsNotifications` and `recurrenceScopes`, alongside `canEditAttendees` (true exactly when `.attendees` is
   writable) and `canRespondToInvite`. `writableFields` and `recurrenceScopes` are empty unless `canWrite`, and `canRespondToInvite` implies `canWrite` (conventions upheld by the read-only defaults and unit tests; the conformance checks verify only `canEditAttendees == writableFields.contains(.attendees)`).
3. `CalendarDescriptor.accessRole` per calendar (a read-only calendar is `.forbidden`).

**Unsupported means an error, never a partial write.** A write that touches something the connector cannot represent
throws `WriteError.unsupported`, naming the fields, before any write request or store change. `WriteValidation.requireWritable(_:_:)`
is the shared check of a set of fields against `writableFields`.

```swift
public enum EventField: String, Sendable, Hashable, CaseIterable { case title, notes, location, timing, availability, visibility, reminders, attendees, recurrence, conference }
public enum NotifyPolicy: Sendable, Hashable { case all, externalOnly, none }        // required argument, no default
public enum RecurrenceScope: Sendable, Hashable, CaseIterable { case thisInstance, thisAndFollowing, allInSeries }
public enum ConferenceRequest: Sendable, Hashable { case none, generate }    // on a draft
public enum ConferenceChange: Sendable, Hashable { case generate, remove }   // on a patch
public enum WriteError: Error, Sendable, Equatable {
    case unsupported(fields: Set<EventField>)   // the connector cannot write these (or the operation; RSVP is reported as .attendees)
    case conflict(fields: Set<EventField>)      // someone else changed a field this patch touches
    case notFound                               // the event or calendar is gone
    case forbidden(String?)                     // read-only calendar or no permission on the event
    case invalid(String)                        // malformed input (end before start, needsAction RSVP, bad rule, ...)
    case partial(String)                        // a multi-step write stopped half way (Google .thisAndFollowing)
}   // auth, network, rate-limit and 5xx stay SourceError
public struct EventRef: Hashable, Sendable {
    var calendarID: String; var eventID: String
    var version: String?; var seriesID: String?
    var originalStart: Date?   // the occurrence's slot in its series; identifies it when eventID is shared, and is the .thisAndFollowing split point
    init(calendarID:eventID:version:seriesID:originalStart:)
    init(_ event: CalendarEvent)
}
```

A ref with a `seriesID` but no `originalStart` is handled per connector. Google: only `.thisAndFollowing` needs it (it throws `.invalid`, "this and following needs the occurrence's original start"); `.thisInstance`, `.allInSeries` and `respond` never read it, except that an `.allInSeries` update with a timing change and no `originalStart` is `.unsupported(fields: [.timing])`. EventKit: `.thisInstance` and `.thisAndFollowing` throw `.invalid` (a recurring occurrence is located by its original start); `.allInSeries` starts from the series' first occurrence and needs it only for a timing change (`.unsupported(fields: [.timing])` without it).
`NotifyPolicy` with `controlsNotifications == false` is accepted only when nobody else would be told (EventKit: only for
an event with no other attendees; otherwise `.unsupported(fields: [.attendees])`).

**Models.**
- `EventTiming { start, end, timeZone, isAllDay }`: time is one unit, in the canonical all-day form; `validate()` throws
  `.invalid` for a non-finite time, `end <= start`, or an all-day timing without a zone or off midnight in it.
- `AttendeeDraft(email:name:role:)`: `Hashable`; the email is trimmed and lowercased on init.
- `EventDraft` (create): `title`, `timing`, `notes`, `location`, `availability` (`.busy`), `visibility` (`.default`),
  `reminders` (`nil` = calendar defaults, empty = none), `attendees: [AttendeeDraft]`, `conference: ConferenceRequest`,
  `recurrence: RecurrenceRule?`. `validate()` checks timing, recurrence, attendee emails and non-negative reminders;
  `usedFields` is what the draft sets beyond defaults. `EventDraft(copying: event, for: capabilities)` is the one lenient
  path: it carries over what the target's `writableFields` allow and drops the rest (self and email-less attendees
  are dropped, an empty reminder list becomes `nil`, only a Meet link is re-requested, recurrence is never copied).
- `EventPatch` (update): optional fields where `nil` means keep (`title`, `timing`, `availability`, `visibility`,
  `attendees`, `conference`) and `FieldUpdate<Value>` = `.keep` (default), `.set(value)` or `.clear` where clearing is
  meaningful (`notes`, `location`, `reminders`, `recurrence`; `.clear` on reminders means the calendar defaults). Attendees are a
  delta, `AttendeeChanges(add:remove:)`, never a replacement list; `add` upserts by email (an existing attendee keeps their
  response). `touchedFields` and `isEmpty` describe what it changes. `private(set) var base: CalendarEvent?` is the original the
  patch was diffed from (`nil` for a hand-built patch), which is what lets conflicts be judged per field.
  `EventPatch(from: original, to: edited)` computes the minimal patch and sets `base`. It compares title, notes, location,
  timing, availability, visibility, reminders and attendees (by normalized email), plus removal of `conference`, and ignores
  provider-owned fields, a changed or added conference, recurrence, the account owner (the `isSelf` attendee), and a name
  cleared to `nil` with the role unchanged (an `AttendeeDraft` cannot express clearing a name). `withoutBase()` drops the
  base; `applied(to:)` applies a patch to an event (used by the in-memory test source; `.clear` reminders gives `[]`).
- `EventEdit(original)` with `event` (the working copy), `patch` and `hasChanges` for callers that want tracked edits.
- `RecurrenceRule`: frequency (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly), interval, weekdays with optional ordinal, month days,
  months, and end (`.never`, `.count(n)`, `.until(date)`), with `init(rrule:in:)`, `validate()` and
  `rruleString(allDay:in:)`. Anything outside this RFC 5545 subset (`BYSETPOS`, `BYHOUR`, sub-daily frequencies,
  `COUNT` with `UNTIL`, a daily rule with `BYDAY`, ...) throws `WriteError.unsupported(fields: [.recurrence])`. EXDATE and RDATE are not
  authorable; removing one occurrence is a `delete` with `.thisInstance`.

**Conflicts.** A write sends `If-Match: ref.version` where the provider supports it (Google etag) or compares
`lastModifiedDate` (EventKit). The shared helper in `CalendarCore` does the rest:

```swift
public enum PatchMerge {
    public enum Attempt<Result> { case done(Result), stale }
    public static func conflicts(patch: EventPatch, current: CalendarEvent) -> Set<EventField>
    public static func apply<Result>(patch: EventPatch, version: String?, maxAttempts: Int = 3,
        fetchCurrent: () async throws -> CalendarEvent,
        write: (String?) async throws -> Attempt<Result>) async throws -> Result
}
```

On `.stale` it fetches the current event and compares only the fields the patch touches against the patch's `base`
(timing as a unit; `nil` and `""` equal for notes and location; reminder order ignored; attendees only for the emails the
patch adds or removes, and an attendee someone else already changed to the wanted state is not a conflict). No difference:
the patch is re-applied on the fresh version and re-judged if it goes stale again. A difference: `WriteError.conflict(fields:)`.
`maxAttempts` is clamped to at least 1, cancellation is checked per attempt, and after the last attempt it throws
`.conflict(fields: touchedFields)`. A patch without a `base` (or that touches `recurrence`) conflicts on any stale
version. Known limitation: a retry whose fetched event has no `version` is an unconditional write.

**Provider mapping.**

| Operation | Google | EventKit |
|---|---|---|
| create | `POST …/events?sendUpdates=…` (`conferenceDataVersion=1` for a generated Meet link) | `EKEvent` save |
| update | `PATCH` of changed fields only, `If-Match`; attendee changes fetch the current event and send the full array | mutate and save |
| delete | `DELETE …?sendUpdates=…` | `remove` with span |
| respond | fetch, set own attendee's `responseStatus`, `PATCH` the full array with the fetched etag (a 412 restarts, three tries) | `.unsupported(fields: [.attendees])` |
| `.thisInstance` | instance id (own etag) | `.thisEvent` |
| `.allInSeries` | master id (its etag differs from the instance's, so no `If-Match`) | first occurrence with `.futureEvents`; no version check |
| `.thisAndFollowing` | delete truncates the master's RRULE `UNTIL`; update truncates then inserts a new series (client-chosen id; rollback only after a definite failure; `.partial` if the rollback fails or the outcome is unknown; a patch that sets or clears `recurrence` replaces or omits the new series' rule instead of copying the master's); `respond` is `.unsupported(fields: [.attendees])` | `.futureEvents` |

An `.allInSeries` update that changes timing is refused with `.unsupported(fields: [.timing])` unless `ref` is the
series' first occurrence (the series' start equals `ref.originalStart`), on Google and EventKit: callers read expanded
instances, so an instance's date would otherwise move the whole series' start.

EventKit's declared capabilities: writes yes, `writableFields` = title, notes, location, timing, availability, reminders
and recurrence, all three scopes, RSVP no, attendee editing no, notification control no. It refuses attendee changes,
`respond`, `visibility` and a generated conference with `.unsupported`, and update or delete on a read-only calendar with
`.forbidden` (an empty-patch update returns before that check). Its writes validate input before checking calendar access.

**Testing seams (`CalendarTestSupport`).** `FakeWritableSource` is an in-memory `WritableCalendarSource` (non-recurring
events, `writeCount`, `simulateExternalEdit`). `WritableSourceConformance.violations(of:calendarID:window:)` runs the
behavior every writable source must have (create and read back, update touches only patched fields, empty patch writes
nothing, unwritable fields throw `.unsupported`, delete and delete-again `.notFound`) and returns a list of violations;
it runs against the fake and, live and opt-in, against the real EventKit source. Google is covered by request-shape tests
with `FakeTransport`. Live tests are gated by `TIMETUG_LIVE_EVENTKIT=1` and `TIMETUG_LIVE_GOOGLE=1` and never run in CI.

**Out of scope for Phase 3:** TimeTug write UI, cross-calendar link orchestration (kept in TimeTug's local store, not in
provider metadata; a `metadata` field and capability can be added later without breaking this API), Microsoft, CalDAV.

## 11. Known gaps

- **EventKit identifiers and write behavior (unverified).** EventKit's `eventIdentifier` is, to our knowledge, shared by
  every occurrence of a series (TimeTug's wrapper id already appends the start time for this reason), so the read model's
  per-instance `eventID` promise is not kept for EventKit; writes identify the occurrence by `EventRef.originalStart`
  (`occurrenceDate`). Reads now fill `seriesID`, `originalStart` and `version`. The EventKit spike has not been run: it
  must confirm the shared identifier, the predicate lookup of a moved occurrence, `.futureEvents` on the first
  occurrence, `refresh()` on a deleted event and `lastModifiedDate` granularity. Run
  `TIMETUG_LIVE_EVENTKIT=1 swift test --package-path Packages/EventKitSource --filter eventKit` (see the spec's Risks).
- **Google write behavior beyond the fake transport (unverified).** `supportsAttachments=true` on a split with
  attachments, the Meet re-request on a new series, and the `COUNT` arithmetic (assumes `events.instances?showDeleted=true`
  includes EXDATE'd occurrences) are checked only against the fake transport until the Google smoke test confirms them.
  Whether the truncation of the old series should notify guests on update is an open decision (spec, Risks).
- **Reminder defaults.** A provider's "use default reminders" and "no reminders" both read as an empty list.
- **Google OAuth client in release builds.** The client id and secret are injected from git-ignored configuration; CI
  injection for release builds is a separate follow-up.
- **No CalDAV or Microsoft connector yet.** They are the next providers; their `AuthorizationMethod` cases (`.password`,
  `.oauth`) are already in the contract.

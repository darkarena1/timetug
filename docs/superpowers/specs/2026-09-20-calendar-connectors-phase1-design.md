# Calendar connectors, Phase 1: portable library + read-only Google connector

Status: draft for review. Approved roadmap: this is Phase 1 of 4 (see "Roadmap"). Nothing in `Apps/macOS`, `TimeTugCore` or `EventKitSource` changes in this phase.

## Goal
A portable Swift package, `Packages/CalendarConnectors`, that defines a provider-neutral calendar model and source interface, a standard way to authorize and reconnect a connector, a change-notification mechanism, and one real connector: read-only Google Calendar. TimeTug does not use it yet (Phase 2).

## Non-goals (Phase 1)
- Writing events, RSVP, `EventDraft`/`EventPatch`, `RecurrenceRule` (Phase 3). Reads use Google's `singleEvents=true` expansion, so no read path produces a recurrence rule; instances carry `seriesID` only.
- Any TimeTug integration, Accounts UI, Keychain code, OAuth browser/loopback listener (all Phase 2; they are the host app's part of the auth flow).
- Microsoft, CalDAV (Phase 4 and later). Push/webhooks (a seam only).
- A live Google smoke test. Phase 1 is verified by unit tests against a fake transport; the first live run is in Phase 2 through the app.

## Roadmap
1. Library + read-only Google connector (this spec). 2. Plug into TimeTug (`CalendarEvent` -> `TimeTugCalendarEvent` rename, dynamic sources, Accounts pane, Keychain, OAuth interaction, mapper). 3. Write capabilities (`WritableCalendarSource`, `EventDraft`/`EventPatch`, `RecurrenceRule`, Google writes, EventKit writable). 4. Microsoft connector and plug it into TimeTug.

## Package
`Packages/CalendarConnectors/Package.swift`: swift-tools 6.0, `platforms: [.macOS(.v14)]`, Swift 6 language mode.
- Products/targets: `CalendarCore` (library, no Apple-only imports, must build on Linux), `GoogleCalendar` (library, depends on `CalendarCore`), test targets `CalendarCoreTests` and `GoogleCalendarTests` (Swift Testing).
- One external dependency: `apple/swift-crypto` (`Crypto`) for SHA-256 in PKCE (CryptoKit is Apple-only). Pin exact, like the app's other dependencies.
- The package has no dependency on TimeTug packages, so the compiler enforces the boundary; no separate import check is needed.
- Networking uses an injected `HTTPTransport` protocol; the default implementation wraps `URLSession` (`import FoundationNetworking` under `#if canImport(FoundationNetworking)` for Linux). Tests inject a fake transport (simpler and more portable than `URLProtocol`).
- Time is passed in (`now`) or comes from an injected `Clock`; library logic never calls `Date()`.

## CalendarCore

### Model
```swift
public struct CalendarDescriptor: Hashable, Sendable {   // one calendar within an account
    public var id: String; public var title: String
    public var colorHex: String?          // "#RRGGBB" uppercase
    public var accessRole: AccessRole     // .owner, .writer, .reader, .freeBusyReader
    public var isPrimary: Bool; public var timeZone: TimeZone?
    public var accountName: String?       // e.g. the signed-in email
}
public struct CalendarEvent: Hashable, Sendable, Identifiable {
    public var eventID: String            // unique within its calendar (a recurring instance has its own id)
    public var id: String { "\(calendarID)/\(eventID)" }   // unique across calendars of one source
    public var uid: String?               // iCalendar UID (Google iCalUID); stable across copies of the same meeting
    public var calendarID: String
    public var title: String; public var notes: String?; public var location: String?
    public var start: Date; public var end: Date      // all-day: midnight of the first day in `timeZone`, end EXCLUSIVE (midnight after the last day)
    public var timeZone: TimeZone?; public var isAllDay: Bool   // `timeZone` is always non-nil when `isAllDay`; consumers must interpret an all-day event's days in that zone, not the device's
    public var status: EventStatus        // .confirmed, .tentative, .cancelled
    public var availability: Availability // .busy, .free
    public var visibility: Visibility     // .default, .publicEvent, .privateEvent, .confidential
    public var kind: EventKind            // .standard, .focusTime, .outOfOffice, .workingLocation, .birthday, .other
    public var seriesID: String?          // recurring instance -> series id
    public var originalStart: Date?       // recurring instance -> its original start
    public var attendees: [Attendee]; public var organizer: Attendee?
    public var conference: ConferenceInfo?
    public var reminders: [Reminder]
    public var url: URL?                  // link to the event in the provider's UI
    public var version: String?           // opaque (Google etag); Phase 3 uses it for optimistic writes
    public var myResponse: ResponseStatus? // the account owner's own response, when the provider says
}
public struct Attendee: Hashable, Sendable { name, email (normalized lowercase), role (.required/.optional/.resource), response: ResponseStatus, isSelf, isOrganizer }
public enum ResponseStatus: String, Sendable { case accepted, tentative, declined, needsAction }
public struct ConferenceInfo: Hashable, Sendable { public var url: URL; public var provider: ConferenceProvider /* .meet, .teams, .zoom, .other */ }
public struct Reminder: Hashable, Sendable { public var minutesBefore: Int }
```
`CalendarEvent` is deliberately smaller than what a provider exposes; unmapped provider data is dropped in Phase 1. TimeTug's dedup fields are not here (they belong to `TimeTugCalendarEvent`).

### Source interface
```swift
public struct SourceCapabilities: Equatable, Sendable {
    public var canWrite = false, canEditAttendees = false, canRespondToInvite = false, providesConference = false
    public var syncKind: SyncKind = .none     // .none, .token, .notification
    public var supportsPush = false
}
public enum CalendarChange: Equatable, Sendable {
    case calendarsChanged; case eventsChanged(calendarIDs: Set<String>?)   // nil = unknown scope
    case sourceFailed(SourceError)     // terminal: the stream finishes after this (e.g. .authExpired) so the app can surface it and re-authorize
}
public protocol CalendarSource: Sendable {
    var id: String { get }; var displayName: String { get }; var capabilities: SourceCapabilities { get }
    func calendars() async throws -> [CalendarDescriptor]
    func events(in interval: DateInterval) async throws -> [CalendarEvent]   // all visible calendars of the account
    func changes() -> AsyncStream<CalendarChange>
}
public protocol PollingCalendarSource: CalendarSource {
    /// One cheap incremental check (sync token / delta). Returns the change since the last call, or nil for none. The first call establishes the baseline and returns nil.
    func checkForChanges() async throws -> CalendarChange?
}
public enum SourceError: Error, Sendable, Equatable { case authExpired, network(String), rateLimited(retryAfter: TimeInterval?), server(status: Int), invalidResponse(String) }
```
`SourceError` here is the library's; TimeTug's adapter (Phase 2) maps `.authExpired` to its own status.

### ChangeMonitor
```swift
public struct ChangeMonitor: Sendable {
    public init(interval: Duration = .seconds(60), maxBackoff: Duration = .seconds(900), clock: any Clock<Duration> = ContinuousClock())
    /// Polls `source.checkForChanges()` until the stream is cancelled, yielding whatever change it returns.
    public func changes(polling source: some PollingCalendarSource) -> AsyncStream<CalendarChange>
}
```
Behavior: sleeps `interval` between checks; on a transient error (network, rate limit, server) waits `min(maxBackoff, interval * (1 << min(failures, 10)))` (exponent clamped before multiplying, so the counter can grow without overflow) and yields nothing; `authExpired` yields `.sourceFailed(.authExpired)` and finishes the stream, so the app is told and can re-authorize instead of the connector going quiet; a success resets the backoff. Sleep uses the injected clock, so tests drive it without real time. `changes()` returns a new poller per call, so the app should hold one subscriber per source (two would double the request volume). A `PushChangeSource` seam is not defined in code in Phase 1 (YAGNI); `SourceCapabilities.supportsPush` and `syncKind` are the documented hooks.

### Connecting
```swift
public struct Platform: OptionSet, Sendable { macOS, iOS, linux, windows; static var current: Platform }
public enum AuthorizationMethod: Sendable { case oauth; case password(fields: [CredentialField]); case system }
public typealias ConnectionID = String
public struct Connection: Codable, Hashable, Sendable, Identifiable {   // non-secret; the app persists it
    public var kindID: String; public var connectionID: ConnectionID; public var displayName: String; public var config: [String: String]
}
public protocol CredentialStore: Sendable {   // a keyed map per connection: Google stores ["refresh_token": ...]; password connectors store their own fields
    func secrets(for: ConnectionID) async throws -> [String: String]?
    func setSecrets(_: [String: String], for: ConnectionID) async throws
    func removeSecrets(for: ConnectionID) async throws
}
public protocol SyncStateStore: Sendable { func token(for: ConnectionID, scope: String) async -> String?; func setToken(_: String?, for: ConnectionID, scope: String) async; func removeAll(for: ConnectionID) async }
public actor InMemoryCredentialStore: CredentialStore { ... }   // tests and short-lived tools; there is no plaintext-file default
public actor InMemorySyncStateStore: SyncStateStore { ... }
public protocol OAuthRedirectSession: Sendable {
    var redirectURI: URL { get }                                    // e.g. http://127.0.0.1:53211
    func authorize(at authorizationURL: URL) async throws -> URL    // opens the browser, waits for the redirect, returns the redirect URL
    func close() async
}
public protocol AuthorizationInteraction: Sendable {
    func beginOAuthRedirect() async throws -> any OAuthRedirectSession
    func promptCredentials(_ fields: [CredentialField]) async throws -> [String: String]   // not used by Google
}
public protocol ConnectorKind: Sendable {
    var id: String { get }; var displayName: String { get }
    var supportedPlatforms: Platform { get }; var authorization: AuthorizationMethod { get }
    func authorize(using: any AuthorizationInteraction, credentials: any CredentialStore) async throws -> Connection
    /// Re-runs sign-in for an existing connection (after `authExpired`): keeps its `connectionID` and `sourceID` so calendar keys and sync state stay valid, replaces the secrets, and throws `invalidResponse` if the user signs in as a different account.
    func reauthorize(_ connection: Connection, using: any AuthorizationInteraction, credentials: any CredentialStore) async throws -> Connection
    func makeSource(for: Connection, credentials: any CredentialStore, syncState: any SyncStateStore) throws -> any CalendarSource
}
public struct ConnectorRegistry: Sendable { register(_:), kind(id:), kinds(for: Platform) }
```
`sourceID` for a connection is `"\(kindID)-\(connectionID)"`, provided by a `Connection.sourceID` helper so every consumer agrees (Phase 2 relies on it for calendar keys).

### OAuth (portable, used by connectors)
- `PKCE`: verifier = 64 random URL-safe characters; challenge = base64url(SHA-256(verifier)), method `S256`. Test with the RFC 7636 appendix B vector.
- `OAuthClient(config: OAuthConfig(authorizationEndpoint, tokenEndpoint, clientID, clientSecret?, scopes, extraAuthParams), transport)`: `authorizationURL(redirectURI:, state:, challenge:)`, `exchange(code:, verifier:, redirectURI:) -> OAuthTokens` (callers must pass the same `redirectURI` as `authorizationURL`; `authorize` reads it once from the session and uses that value for both), `refresh(refreshToken:) -> OAuthTokens`. `OAuthTokens { accessToken, expiresAt (from injected now), refreshToken? }`. `invalid_grant` on refresh throws `SourceError.authExpired`; other OAuth errors throw `.invalidResponse`.
- `AccessTokenProvider` (actor): holds the cached access token, returns it if it has more than 60 s left, else refreshes using the stored refresh token from `CredentialStore`, persisting a rotated refresh token if the response supplies one. Concurrent callers share one in-flight refresh. `invalidate()` forces a refresh (used after a 401).
- Validation: the redirect `state` must match; an `error` query item (e.g. `access_denied`) becomes a cancellation error, not a crash.

## GoogleCalendar
- `GoogleOAuthConfig { clientID, clientSecret }` is injected by the app (values come from git-ignored config; never in this package). `GoogleConnectorKind(config:, transport:, now:)`: id `google`, displayName "Google", supports all platforms, `.oauth`.
- Scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` (also what Phase 3 writes need) and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.calendarlist.readonly`. Request `access_type=offline` and `prompt=consent` so a refresh token is issued.
- `authorize`: begin redirect session, build the PKCE authorization URL with a random `state`, `authorize(at:)`, validate state, exchange the code, call `calendarList` with the new access token and take the `primary` entry's id (the account email) as `displayName`, and only then store the refresh token via `CredentialStore` under a fresh `ConnectionID` (UUID string), so a failed `calendarList` leaves nothing stored. The redirect session is closed in a `defer`. Return `Connection(kindID: "google", connectionID:, displayName: email, config: ["email": email])`. If no refresh token is returned, throw `invalidResponse`. `reauthorize` runs the same flow, requires the primary calendar id to equal `config["email"]`, and overwrites the secrets under the existing `ConnectionID`.
- `GoogleCalendarSource` (id `google-<connectionID>`):
  - `calendars()`: `GET calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList` (paged, `showHidden=false`, `minAccessRole=freeBusyReader`), mapping `summaryOverride ?? summary`, `backgroundColor` (normalized), `accessRole`, `primary`, `timeZone`, `accountName` = email. `selected == false` entries are kept but the app decides visibility (Phase 2).
  - `events(in:)`: for each calendar concurrently, `GET calendars/{id}/events` with `singleEvents=true`, `timeMin`/`timeMax` (RFC 3339), `maxResults=250`, paging via `nextPageToken`, `showDeleted=false`, and a `fields` mask limited to what the mapper reads. A calendar returning 404 or 403 `forbidden` is skipped (removed or lost access) without failing the whole account; other errors propagate.
  - Mapping (pure, unit-tested from JSON fixtures): timed events use `dateTime` with `timeZone`; all-day events use `date` (midnight of the given date in the calendar's zone, else UTC; `timeZone` is set to that zone; end exclusive as Google supplies it; Google's `date` values carry no per-event zone); `status == cancelled` events are dropped; `eventType` maps to `kind`; `transparency == transparent` is `.free`; `attendees[]` map with `self`, `organizer`, `optional`, `resource`, `responseStatus` (and `myResponse` from the `self` attendee; nil when there are no attendees); `conferenceData.entryPoints` with `entryPointType == "video"` gives the conference URL (provider from `conferenceSolution.key.type`), falling back to `hangoutLink`; `reminders.overrides` (when `useDefault` is false) to `Reminder`s; `htmlLink` to `url`; `etag` to `version`; `recurringEventId`/`originalStartTime` to `seriesID`/`originalStart`.
  - Auth failures: a 401 invalidates the access token and retries once, then throws `authExpired`. 403/429 with `rateLimitExceeded`/`userRateLimitExceeded` are retried up to 3 times with jittered backoff (delay honoring `Retry-After`), then throw `rateLimited`. 5xx throws `server`. Network errors throw `network`.
  - `capabilities`: `canWrite` false, `providesConference` true, `syncKind` `.token`, `supportsPush` false.
  - `changes()`: returns `ChangeMonitor().changes(polling: self)`.
  - `checkForChanges()`: first `calendars()`. The calendar set is itself tracked as a token under scope `_calendars` (the sorted ids joined); if it differs from the stored value, store the new value and report `.calendarsChanged` (an added or removed calendar), clearing the tokens of calendars that disappeared. Then per calendar: if `SyncStateStore` has no token, **bootstrap** by listing the whole calendar with `showDeleted=true`, `maxResults=2500` and `fields=nextPageToken,nextSyncToken`, paging (no page cap; the loop honors task cancellation) until `nextSyncToken` is returned, and store it; a bootstrap on a source that already has a baseline (a newly added calendar) reports `.calendarsChanged` via the set change above, and the very first call ever reports nil (baseline). Otherwise list with `syncToken`, `showDeleted=true` (Google requires it whenever `syncToken` is used; use the same value in both requests), `maxResults=250`, `fields=nextPageToken,nextSyncToken,items(id)`, following pages until `nextSyncToken` (only the last page carries it); any item means `.eventsChanged(calendarIDs:)` for that calendar; store the new token. HTTP 410 clears the token, re-bootstraps, and reports `.eventsChanged` for that calendar. The result merges the per-calendar results into one change (calendar ids unioned; `.calendarsChanged` wins). A failure mid-bootstrap stores nothing and simply retries next interval (converges, because there is no cap). Google forbids combining `syncToken` with `timeMin`/`timeMax`, which is why the check is a separate whole-calendar listing rather than the windowed one.
  - `.calendarsChanged` means reload calendars and events (event changes found in the same check are folded into it).
  - The first `checkForChanges` after connecting costs one full (field-minimal) listing per calendar; a calendar with many thousands of events takes several pages of 2500. Each poll also costs one `calendarList` request. Acceptable.
- The Desktop OAuth client's non-secret "client secret" is required by Google's token endpoint for that client type; it is supplied by the app, not embedded here.

## Error handling summary
Library errors are `SourceError` (auth, network, rate limit, server, invalid response). Sources never throw provider-specific types. Cancellation (`CancellationError`) propagates untouched. Parsing a single malformed event drops that event and records nothing else (no logging in the library); a wholly unparseable response throws `invalidResponse`.

## Testing (Swift Testing, TDD: failing test first)
- `CalendarCoreTests`: `Connection` Codable round trip and decoding with unknown extra keys; `Connection.sourceID`; `ConnectorRegistry` filtering by platform; `SyncStateStore.removeAll`; `PKCE` vs RFC 7636 vector and verifier alphabet/length; `OAuthClient` authorization URL and token exchange/refresh via fake transport (including `invalid_grant`, rotated refresh token); `AccessTokenProvider` (secrets read from `CredentialStore` under key `refresh_token`; cache hit, expiry refresh, single in-flight refresh under concurrency, rotation persisted, `invalidate`); `ChangeMonitor` with a manual test clock (interval, backoff doubling and cap, no overflow after thousands of failures, reset on success, `authExpired` yields `.sourceFailed` then finishes, cancellation); `InMemory*` stores.
- `GoogleCalendarTests`: mapping fixtures (timed, all-day, multi-day all-day exclusive end, recurring instance, cancelled dropped, declined by self, no attendees, conference via `conferenceData` and via `hangoutLink`, focus-time and out-of-office kinds, reminders default vs overrides, missing fields); calendar list mapping; paging; per-calendar skip on 404/403; 401 retry then `authExpired`; 429 backoff then `rateLimited`; `authorize` happy path (state check, no-refresh-token error, `access_denied`); `checkForChanges` (bootstrap returns nil, unchanged, changed, 410 re-bootstrap, multi-page with a token only on the last page, `showDeleted=true` on both requests, calendar added or removed reports `.calendarsChanged` and clears stale tokens, failure mid-bootstrap stores nothing and converges on retry); `reauthorize` (same `ConnectionID`, different account rejected); `authorize` failure after token exchange stores nothing; redirect session closed.
- Commands: `swift test --package-path Packages/CalendarConnectors`. CI: extend the existing `core` job with that command and a Linux build of the package in `core-linux` (allowed to fail like today; the goal is to prove portability).

## Docs and repo changes
- New ADR `docs/decisions/0012-calendar-connector-library.md`: decision to build a portable connector library in-repo (extract later), poll-with-sync-tokens with a push seam, `CredentialStore` as our abstraction, no Apple-only OAuth dependencies, connector capabilities per connector, the `CalendarEvent`/`TimeTugCalendarEvent` naming, Google verification caveats (sensitive scope; Testing mode 7-day refresh-token expiry; verification for public release).
- `AGENTS.md`: layout entry for `Packages/CalendarConnectors`, its test command, and the rule "the library imports nothing from TimeTug; TimeTug's EventKit connector lives in TimeTug".
- `docs/architecture.md`: short pointer.

## Risks and open questions
- Google Cloud OAuth client (Desktop) must exist before Phase 2's live testing; the user creates it (Calendar API enabled; add the account as a test user).
- `swift-crypto` adds a first-build network fetch (already true for KeyboardShortcuts/Sparkle).
- `CalendarSource` is also the name of TimeTug's existing protocol. They live in different modules; Phase 2's adapter module-qualifies them. If that proves clumsy, rename TimeTug's in Phase 2.
- Bootstrapping a sync token on very large calendars is the most expensive operation (several 2500-item pages, once per calendar per connection). Persisting the sync tokens across launches (Phase 2) avoids repeating it.

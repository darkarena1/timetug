# Calendar connectors, Phase 4: Microsoft (Outlook) connector

Status: design approved in brainstorming (2026-09-25); implemented, and reconciled with the code below (the "As built" notes). The live checks are still to be run: see "Manual checklist" and "Live findings". Phases 1, 2, 2.5 and 3 are merged (#16, #17, #18, #32, #38). This phase adds a Microsoft Graph connector to the connector library with full parity with Google (read, change detection, writes, series) and plugs it into TimeTug's Accounts tab. The API contract is in `docs/calendar-connectors-api.md`; its Phase 4 note ("until a second provider has proved the API is provider-neutral") is what this phase closes.

## Goals

1. Sign in with a Microsoft account (personal Outlook.com/Hotmail/Live, or work/school Microsoft 365) and read its calendars and events like any other source.
2. Poll for changes cheaply with Graph delta queries, so the app refreshes when something changes without fetching everything.
3. Write: create, update, delete, respond to invites, with recurrence scopes, attendees and Teams links, through the Phase 3 `WritableCalendarSource` API.
4. Read a series' recurrence rule (`SeriesSource`).
5. Keep the library layering rule: the connector is pure Swift with no external dependencies and builds on Linux; OS-specific code stays in `CalendarApple` and the app.

## Non-goals

- No webhook push (Graph subscriptions need a public endpoint; polling was chosen for every provider).
- No MSAL and no Microsoft SDK. The connector is a small REST client over the library's `HTTPTransport`.
- No free/busy-only calendars beyond what `permissions.canViewDetails` already expresses.
- No shipping the Microsoft client id in beta and release builds beyond wiring the CI injection (see "App wiring").
- No moving events between calendars, no Graph extensions or open-type metadata, no attachments.
- No CalDAV or iCloud-direct connector (a later phase).

## Decisions

Made with the user during brainstorming:

- **Scope: full parity with Google.** Reads, delta sync, writes, `SeriesSource`.
- **Accounts: work/school and personal**, authority `common`. Work tenants other than the registering one need admin consent while the app has no verified publisher; the connector surfaces that as a sign-in error, it does not work around it.
- **Change detection: `calendarView/delta` over a rolling window**, re-baselined before it ages out. (Rejected: fetch-and-hash each poll, wasteful; `lastModifiedDateTime` filter, misses deletions.)
- **Public client, PKCE, no secret.** `OAuthConfig.clientSecret` is already optional.
- **Optimistic locking by read-before-write plus `PatchMerge`**, not `If-Match` (Graph's ETag support on events is not dependable).

## Placement

| Package | New or changed |
|---|---|
| `CalendarCore` | `CalendarService.microsoft` (one static constant) and the `controlsNotifications` doc comment (see Writes) |
| `CalendarOAuth` | `interaction_required` from the token endpoint is `SourceError.authExpired`, like `invalid_grant` |
| `CalendarConnectors` (`Sources/MicrosoftCalendar`, new target and library product) | `MicrosoftConnectorKind`, `MicrosoftOAuthConfig`, `MicrosoftCalendarSource` (`+Sync`, `+Write`, `+Split`, `+Series`), `GraphAPIClient`, `GraphDTOs`, `GraphTime`, `GraphEventMapper`, `GraphWriteMapper`, `GraphRecurrenceMapper`, `WindowsTimeZones` |
| `CalendarTestSupport` | reused as is (`WritableSourceConformance`, `AllDayConformance`, `ProvidedFieldsConformance`) |
| `CalendarApple` | Microsoft live smoke test (no session change: the redirect host is `MicrosoftOAuthConfig.redirectHost`, see Sign-in) |
| `Apps/macOS` | `MicrosoftOAuthSettings`, `AppConnectors` registration, `project.yml` and `Signing.xcconfig` keys, Accounts tab entry, `scripts/dev/link-signing.sh` and CI helper |
| `TimeTugCore`, `CalendarBridge` | none |

Everything in `MicrosoftCalendar` uses only Foundation and the library, like `GoogleCalendar`.

## Sign-in

`MicrosoftConnectorKind` mirrors `GoogleConnectorKind`.

- `kindID = "microsoft"`, `displayName = "Microsoft"` (the Accounts tab may show "Outlook" as the subtitle), `authorization = .oauth`, all four platforms.
- Endpoints: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize` and `.../token`.
- Scopes: `offline_access`, `User.Read`, `MailboxSettings.Read`, `Calendars.ReadWrite`, `Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared`. `.Shared` gives parity with Google's calendar list (shared and delegated calendars); `MailboxSettings.Read` is for the account's time zone (see Time zones). None needs admin consent by itself. Consent is another matter for work and school accounts: an app registered without a verified publisher (a Microsoft Cloud Partner Program step, out of scope) cannot get user consent in other organizations' tenants, so a work account outside the registering tenant needs its admin to approve the app. Personal accounts and the registering tenant are unaffected. The connector reports the resulting sign-in error as is.
- `MicrosoftOAuthConfig` holds the client id and `redirectHost` (default `localhost`; see Risk 1). The registration lists `http://localhost`, which Microsoft matches ignoring the port, so the redirect URI sent is `http://localhost:<port>` while the loopback session's listener keeps binding the loopback interface; `nil` keeps the session's own host (`127.0.0.1`). Extra auth parameter: `prompt=select_account`, so a user with several Microsoft accounts is not silently signed in as the wrong one.
- After the code exchange, `GET /me?$select=mail,userPrincipalName` gives the account identity. The connection's `config["email"]` is `mail` if present, else `userPrincipalName`, lowercased, and `displayName` is that address. `reauthorize` throws `SourceError.invalidResponse("signed in as a different account")` when the identity differs, exactly like Google, and stores secrets only after sign-in succeeds.
- Secrets: `["refresh_token": ...]` through `AccessTokenProvider`. Microsoft rotates refresh tokens; `AccessTokenProvider` already writes a rotated one back to the store, so no change is needed there. `invalid_grant` becomes `SourceError.authExpired`; work tenants may also return `interaction_required`, which maps to `authExpired` too.

## Reads

Base URL `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`. `GraphAPIClient` mirrors `GoogleAPIClient`: bearer token from `AccessTokenProvider`, paging through `@odata.nextLink`, `429` and `503` retry honoring `Retry-After` (through the injected sleeper), and a typed `GraphAPIError` (`gone`, `notFound`, `forbidden`, `conflict`, `preconditionFailed`, `badRequest`) with a `sourceError` translation. Throttling (429, 503, 504) is handled inside the client and ends as `SourceError.rateLimited` or `.server`.

Every request sends `Prefer: IdType="ImmutableId"` so ids survive folder moves. Event reads also send `Prefer: outlook.timezone="<account zone>"` (see Time zones).

**Time zones.** Graph reports times as a `dateTime` plus a `timeZone`, and returns UTC unless the request names a zone with `Prefer: outlook.timezone`. The zone an event was scheduled in is only available as `originalStartTimeZone`. The library needs a zone at two levels: per event (`CalendarEvent.timeZone`) and per calendar (`CalendarDescriptor.timeZone`, which anchors all-day dates). The connector uses the account's mailbox zone as the calendar zone:

- `GET /me/mailboxSettings/timeZone` (scope `MailboxSettings.Read`) gives the account's default zone, a Windows name such as `Pacific Standard Time` or an IANA name. `WindowsTimeZones` (a bidirectional table, Windows to IANA and back, pure Swift, no ICU dependency) turns it into a `TimeZone`. A refused scope (403), a Graph error or a name not in the table falls back to `UTC` (remembered), so `CalendarDescriptor.timeZone` is never nil. A failure that may pass (network, server, throttling) is not a fallback: it is rethrown, so events are never read in the wrong zone. The zone is read on each `calendars()` call (one small request), since the user can change it, and the source remembers it for `events(in:)`.
- Every calendar in the account gets that zone. A shared calendar owned by someone in another zone is still described in the account's zone; that only affects where an all-day event falls on the calendar grid, not any timed instant.
- Reads send `Prefer: outlook.timezone` set to the account zone's raw name (or `UTC` after a fallback), and `Prefer: outlook.body-content-type="text"`, so `dateTime` values are in the account zone and an all-day event falls on the date the user sees in Outlook. Instants are computed from `dateTime` plus that zone, never from a bare local string.
- `CalendarEvent.timeZone`: for a timed event, `originalStartTimeZone` mapped through the table (the zone it was scheduled in, so the event displays as its organizer meant it), else the account zone; for an all-day event, the account zone.

**Calendars.** `GET /me/calendars` (owned and shared). Mapping: `id`, `name`, `hexColor` (the only color source: Graph's `color` enum is not used as a fallback, so a calendar without a `hexColor` has none), `isDefaultCalendar` to `isDefault`, `canEdit`, `canShare`, `canViewPrivateItems` to `CalendarPermissions`, `owner.address` or the account email to `accountName`, `provider = .microsoft`, `service = .microsoft`, `supportedAvailabilities = [.busy, .free, .tentative, .unavailable]` (Graph's `showAs`: free, tentative, busy, oof, workingElsewhere; `workingElsewhere` reads as `.free`). `timeZone` is the account's mailbox zone (see Time zones). `defaultReminders` is nil: Graph's calendar resource has no reminder defaults (reminders live on events).

**Events.** `GET /me/calendars/{id}/calendarView?startDateTime&endDateTime&$top=100`, paged. Occurrences come expanded. One task per calendar, results merged and sorted like Google. A calendar that answers 404 or 403 is skipped. Items with `isCancelled == true` are dropped.

`GraphEventMapper` maps:

| Library field | Graph |
|---|---|
| `eventID` | `id` (immutable) |
| `uid`, `uidScope` | `iCalUId`, `.global` |
| `title`, `notes`, `location` | `subject`, `body` (requested as text through the `Prefer` header; a body that still arrives as HTML is reduced to text by the mapper), `location.displayName` |
| `start`, `end`, `timeZone` | `start`/`end` `dateTime` interpreted in the zone the response names (the account zone, because of the `Prefer` header); `timeZone` as in Time zones |
| `isAllDay` | `isAllDay`, converted to the library's canonical all-day form with the `AllDay` helper (exclusive end, calendar date in the event's zone); must pass `AllDayConformance` |
| `status` | `isCancelled` cancelled; `showAs == tentative` is availability, not status; everything else confirmed |
| `availability` | `showAs` |
| `visibility` | `sensitivity`: normal default, personal/private private, confidential confidential |
| `kind` | standard (Graph has no focus/OOO event type; `showAs == oof` stays availability) |
| `series` | `type`: `singleInstance` is not recurring; `occurrence`/`exception` give `.occurrence(seriesID: seriesMasterId, originalStart: originalStart)`; a `seriesMaster` is its own series, `.occurrence(seriesID: its id, originalStart: its start)`, so a single-instance write on it can be refused |
| `attendees`, `organizer` | `attendees[].emailAddress`, `type` (required/optional/resource), `status.response`; organizer from `organizer`; `isSelf` by matching the account email |
| `participation` | `.invited(response)` from `responseStatus.response` when the account is an attendee and not the organizer, else `.notInvited` |
| `reminders` | `isReminderOn` and `reminderMinutesBeforeStart` (relative, start-anchored, `.display`) |
| `conferences` | `onlineMeeting.joinUrl` as a structured Teams conference; the `ConferenceDetector` scan of location, body and URL remains the fallback |
| `version` | `changeKey` |
| `lastModified`, `created` | `lastModifiedDateTime`, `createdDateTime` |
| `url` | `webLink` |

Declared `providedFields`: `.kind`, `.visibility`, `.availability`, `.reminders`, `.series`, `.participation`, `.structuredConference`, `.version`, `.lastModified`, `.created`, `.uidScope`, `.recurrenceRules` (see Series), `.isDefault`, `.calendarTimeZone`, `.provider`, `.supportedAvailabilities`, `.permissionDetails`. Google's list minus `.defaultReminders`, which Graph does not supply.

## Change detection

`checkForChanges()` follows the Google source's structure with Graph's delta.

- Per calendar id, the `SyncStateStore` scope holds a `deltaLink` and the window it was baselined on, encoded together as `"<baselineDate>|<deltaLink>"` (the store is string-only).
- **Baseline:** `GET /me/calendars/{id}/calendarView/delta?startDateTime=now-30d&endDateTime=now+365d` with `Prefer: odata.maxpagesize=200`, walking `@odata.nextLink` to the last page, discarding items and keeping `@odata.deltaLink`.
- **Poll:** `GET` the stored `deltaLink`, walk to the last page, count items (including `@removed` ones), and store the new `deltaLink`. Any item means the calendar changed. Items that fail to parse still count.
- **Re-baseline:** after polling, when the baseline is older than 14 days (so the window always keeps at least 16 days back and 350 days ahead), fetch a fresh baseline. A re-baseline discards the items it lists, so an edit made between the poll and the fresh baseline would otherwise never be reported; the re-baseline therefore reports `.eventsChanged` for that calendar, like the `410` path (one extra refresh every 14 days). A `410 Gone` or invalid-token answer also triggers a re-baseline, reported the same way, because changes may have been missed.
- The calendar set is tracked as for Google (`_calendars` scope): a changed set reports `.calendarsChanged`, and tokens for removed calendars are dropped.
- The first call establishes baselines and returns nil.
- `capabilities.syncKind = .token`, `supportsPush = false`. The source is a `PollingCalendarSource` driven by `ChangeMonitor`.

## Series

`MicrosoftCalendarSource` conforms to `SeriesSource` and declares `.recurrenceRules`.

`GraphRecurrenceMapper` converts Graph's `patternedRecurrence` to and from `RecurrenceRule`:

| Graph pattern | RecurrenceRule |
|---|---|
| `daily` + `interval` | `DAILY;INTERVAL` |
| `weekly` + `daysOfWeek` + `firstDayOfWeek` | `WEEKLY;BYDAY;WKST` (read only; writes always send Monday, see below) |
| `absoluteMonthly` + `dayOfMonth` | `MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY` |
| `relativeMonthly` + `daysOfWeek` + `index` | `MONTHLY;BYDAY` with ordinal (first=1 ... fourth=4, last=-1) |
| `absoluteYearly` + `month` + `dayOfMonth` | `YEARLY;BYMONTH;BYMONTHDAY` |
| `relativeYearly` + `month` + `daysOfWeek` + `index` | `YEARLY;BYMONTH;BYDAY` with ordinal |

Range: `noEnd` is never, `numbered` is `COUNT`, `endDate` is `UNTIL` (end of that date in the recurrence zone).

Writing accepts only what Graph can express and throws `WriteError.unsupported(fields: [.recurrence])` otherwise (never mangles): ordinals other than 1...4 and -1, more than one month day, a yearly rule with several months, and any `unrecognizedParts`. A non-Monday `weekStart` is not writable: `RecurrenceRule.validate()` already rejects it as `.unsupported(fields: [.recurrence])` for every connector, so writes only ever send Monday as `firstDayOfWeek`. Reading maps `firstDayOfWeek` to the rule's `weekStart` and never throws for a rule Graph produced.

`series(id:calendarID:)` fetches the master (`GET /me/events/{id}` with the immutable id) and returns its rule and start. A 404, or a master that is not a series (`type` is not `seriesMaster`, or `recurrence` is absent), throws `SourceError.notFound`. The set's `excludedDates` and `extraDates` are nil, as for EventKit: Graph's `exceptionOccurrences` navigation is beta-only and the connector does not derive them from `calendarView`. A pattern the mapper does not know is kept in `unparsed`. (Risk 3 is closed by this choice.)

## Writes

`MicrosoftCalendarSource: WritableCalendarSource` (`+Write` extension), with `GraphWriteMapper` translating `EventDraft` and `EventPatch` to Graph JSON.

**Capabilities.** `canWrite`, `canEditAttendees` and `canRespondToInvite` true; `writableFields` all fields; `recurrenceScopes` all three; `controlsNotifications = false`. Graph has no `sendUpdates`: it emails attendees when the organizer creates, updates or cancels. The library's contract for `controlsNotifications == false` is "the server decides", the same as EventKit, so `NotifyPolicy` is accepted and ignored on create, update and delete (Graph emails attendees whatever the caller asks; Risk 4 records what each account type actually does). The one exception is `respond`, which passes `sendResponse: false` when `notify == .none` and `true` otherwise. Delete is always a plain `DELETE`. The exception is recorded in the doc comment on `SourceCapabilities.controlsNotifications` ("false means the server decides for create, update and delete; a connector may still honor the policy for a response to an invite"), the only change to `SourceTypes.swift`.

**Create.** With a draft `uid`, look up `iCalUId eq '<uid>'` on the target calendar first; a hit throws `.alreadyExists(storedCopy)` and writes nothing. `iCalUId` is read-only in Graph, so `EventDraft.uid` is used only for this duplicate check and is never stored: a created event gets its own uid. Otherwise `POST /me/calendars/{id}/events`. A recurring draft carries `recurrence` (rule mapped as above, `range.startDate` from the draft start in its zone).

**Update.** Read the current event, run `PatchMerge` against `EventPatch.base` to detect a field-level conflict (`WriteError.conflict(fields:)`), then send only the changed fields with `PATCH`. Timing patches send `start` and `end` as local `dateTime` values with the event's zone written as a Windows name (from the reverse table; a zone with no Windows entry is sent as UTC with the instant converted); an all-day event sends midnight dateTimes in the account zone with `isAllDay: true`. Attendee patches send the full attendee list (Graph replaces it). Reminders: Graph keeps one per event, so an empty list turns it off, one plain on-screen start-relative reminder turns it on, and anything else is `.unsupported(fields: [.reminders])`; `.clear` on reminders is unsupported too (there is no calendar default to fall back to). Recurrence can be set but not removed (`.clear` is `.unsupported(fields: [.recurrence])`). Writes send `Prefer: outlook.timezone` for the returned event, and text bodies. Conference: `generate` sets `isOnlineMeeting: true` and `onlineMeetingProvider: "teamsForBusiness"`; `remove` sets `isOnlineMeeting: false`.

**Scope handling.**

| Scope | Target |
|---|---|
| not in a series | the event id |
| `.thisInstance` | the ref's `eventID`, the occurrence's own id (from `calendarView`); Graph turns it into an exception. An occurrence is never looked up by `originalStart`: the ref's `originalStart` is only the `.thisAndFollowing` split point. A series master ref is refused (`.invalid`) |
| `.allInSeries` | `seriesMasterId` |
| `.thisAndFollowing` | a split at the series' first occurrence is the same as `.allInSeries` and is handled as that. Otherwise emulated: rewrite the master's recurrence range to end before the split (a `numbered` range becomes `endDate`; the instances before the split are counted through the master's `instances` endpoint, which may not list a deleted occurrence, so the count can be short), then create a new series from the split point carrying the master's fields plus the patch. The new series keeps the master's pattern; its range is `noEnd` for `noEnd`, the same `endDate` for `endDate`, and for `numbered` the *remaining* count (original count minus the instances before the split), so the total stays the same. The insert carries a `transactionId` and is sent once more if its reply is lost, so a retry cannot make a second series. A definite failure of the insert restores the master's original range (even for a cancelled caller); `WriteError.partial` reports a failed restore or an insert whose outcome is unknown, as Google does. |

**Delete.** `DELETE` on the same targets. `.thisInstance` deletes the occurrence, which Graph records as a cancelled exception.

**Respond.** `POST /me/events/{id}/accept`, `tentativelyAccept` or `decline` with `{ "sendResponse": <bool> }`; `.needsAction` throws `.invalid`. Scope handling as above (`.allInSeries` targets the master). The result is the re-read event.

**Errors.** `GraphAPIError` maps to `WriteError` as Google's does: 404 and `410` to `.notFound`, 403 to `.forbidden`, 400 to `.invalid`, and 412/409 to `SourceError.invalidResponse` (no `If-Match` is sent, so they are unexpected).

## App wiring

- `MicrosoftOAuthSettings` (like `GoogleOAuthSettings`) reads `TimeTugMicrosoftClientID` from Info.plist; without it Microsoft is not offered and everything else works.
- `Signing.xcconfig` includes a git-ignored `MicrosoftOAuth.xcconfig` (`MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`); `scripts/dev/link-signing.sh` links it from `~/.config/timetug/microsoft-oauth.xcconfig`; `project.yml` injects `TimeTugMicrosoftClientID`.
- `AppConnectors.makeRegistry` registers `MicrosoftConnectorKind` when the config is present, with `CryptoKitSHA256`.
- The Accounts tab already lists registered kinds; no new UI beyond the kind's name and icon. Re-authorize and remove flows are the existing ones.
- CI: `scripts/ci/microsoft-oauth-config.sh` mirrors the Google helper for `MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` (one variable; a public client id is not a secret but stays out of git), used by `build-release.sh` and the beta and release workflows. The value comes from the optional repository secret `MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`; adding it is the user's step.

## Prerequisites (the user)

An Azure app registration (Microsoft Entra, "App registrations"), with:

- Supported account types: accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts.
- Platform: "Mobile and desktop applications" with redirect URI `http://localhost` (Microsoft ignores the port for loopback redirects).
- "Allow public client flows": yes.
- API permissions (delegated): `offline_access`, `User.Read`, `MailboxSettings.Read`, `Calendars.ReadWrite`, `Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared`.
- The Application (client) id goes in `~/.config/timetug/microsoft-oauth.xcconfig` as `MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID = ...`.

For live testing: one personal Outlook.com account and, ideally, one Microsoft 365 work account.

## Testing

- **Library unit tests** on `FakeTransport`, in a new `MicrosoftCalendarTests` target: sign-in and re-authorize (identity, wrong account, cancel, refresh-token rotation), the API client (paging, retry, error translation), the mailbox zone lookup (Windows name, IANA name, unknown name, 403, failure: each ends in a zone, UTC on failure), `GraphEventMapper` fixtures (timed with and without `originalStartTimeZone`, all-day in the account zone and in UTC, cancelled, occurrence and exception, attendees and self, Teams, reminders), `WindowsTimeZones`, `GraphRecurrenceMapper` round trips over every pattern and the unsupported writes, delta baseline, poll, removal, re-baseline after 14 days, `410`, and calendar-set changes.
- **Conformance:** `AllDayConformance`, `ProvidedFieldsConformance` and `WritableSourceConformance` against a stubbed transport, as for Google; write tests for create (including `.alreadyExists`), update (merge, conflict), delete, respond and every scope, and for `.thisAndFollowing` including numbered-range arithmetic, split at the first occurrence, and the partial-failure rollback.
- **App tests:** `MicrosoftOAuthSettingsTests` (missing, placeholder and valid values) and the `AppConnectorsTests` registry cases.
- **Live smoke** (`TIMETUG_LIVE_MICROSOFT=1`, in `CalendarApple` tests like the Google one): the risks below, recorded in the "Live findings" section of this spec when it is run. Needs the user's client id and an account to sign in with.
- `core-linux` still builds `CalendarCore` and now `MicrosoftCalendar`.

## Risks (verify in the live spike)

1. **Loopback redirect host.** The loopback session builds `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`; Microsoft's registration takes `http://localhost` and ignores the port. Decided instead of tested: the connector sends `http://localhost:<port>` (`MicrosoftOAuthConfig.redirectHost`), the listener still binds the loopback interface. To confirm live: that sign-in completes, and, if `localhost` resolves to `::1` first in the browser, that the IPv4-only listener is still reached (else bind IPv6 too).
2. **Time zones.** Confirm `Prefer: outlook.timezone` accepts the raw mailbox name (Windows or IANA), that all-day events land on the right date in it, that `originalStartTimeZone` is present on events created elsewhere (Outlook web, iPhone, an invite from another tenant), that writes accept the zone names the connector sends (Windows names are the safe form; IANA names are used only if the live run shows Graph accepts them), and that the table covers the zones seen in the wild.
3. **Exdates.** Closed by design: `excludedDates` and `extraDates` are nil (see Series). Confirm live only that moved and cancelled occurrences read back correctly through `calendarView`.
4. **Notifications on create, update and delete**, and whether personal accounts and work accounts behave the same.
5. **Teams generation** for personal accounts (`teamsForBusiness` versus consumer providers) and the `onlineMeeting` field shape returned.
6. **Delta window behavior:** that a `deltaLink` keeps working across 14 days and reports `@removed` for cancelled occurrences.
7. **Delegated and shared calendars** appear in `/me/calendars` with `.Shared` consent and are readable and (where permitted) writable.
8. **Refresh-token rotation:** confirm live that a connection keeps working across several refreshes (the write-back exists; this checks Microsoft's behavior against it).

## As built: differences from the design

Reconciled with the code; the sections above already carry the corrected text. In short:

- The redirect host is `MicrosoftOAuthConfig.redirectHost`, defaulting to `localhost`; `CalendarApple`'s loopback session is unchanged.
- There is no color-enum fallback: a calendar's color is its `hexColor` or nothing.
- An occurrence is never looked up by `originalStart`; the ref's `originalStart` is only the `.thisAndFollowing` split point.
- `SeriesSource` returns nil `excludedDates` and `extraDates`; nothing is derived from `calendarView`.
- Writes only ever send Monday as `firstDayOfWeek` (`RecurrenceRule.validate()` rejects any other week start).
- Reads send `Prefer: outlook.body-content-type="text"`.
- `iCalUId` is read-only: `EventDraft.uid` is used only for the duplicate check and is not stored.
- A numbered split counts the prior occurrences through the master's `instances` endpoint.
- Also as built: reminders and recurrence cannot be cleared (`.unsupported`); a network or server failure reading the mailbox zone is rethrown rather than treated as UTC; the identity request selects `mail,userPrincipalName` only.

## Manual checklist (the user, in the app, with the real account)

- [ ] Add the Microsoft account in Settings > Accounts: it appears in the list with the right name (its email address).
- [ ] Events from the Outlook calendar appear in TimeTug and tug on time.
- [ ] A Teams meeting shows its Join link.
- [ ] A shared or delegated calendar (if the account has one) appears read-only or writable to match its permissions.
- [ ] Remove the account and add it again.
- [ ] After 14 or more days of running, a poll re-baselines silently (no error, no spurious refresh storm).

## Live findings

Not yet run. The opt-in smoke test (`TIMETUG_LIVE_MICROSOFT=1 ... --filter microsoftWriteSmoke`, see `AGENTS.md`) needs the user's client id and an account to sign in with. When it has been run, paste its `LIVE ...` lines here, one entry per risk above (sign-in with the `localhost` redirect, calendars and the account zone, version and uid scope of a created event, Teams generation, the numbered split and `originalStart` on occurrences), and correct any section they contradict.

## Open questions

None. Anything the live spike contradicts is recorded in a "Live findings" section and the affected section is corrected.

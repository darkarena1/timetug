# Calendar connectors, Phase 5: CalDAV and iCloud connector

Status: implemented on branch `claude/icloud-connection-4286cc`; see As built. Design approved in brainstorming (2026-09-27). Phases 1 to 4 are merged (#16, #17, #18, #32, #38, #40). This phase adds a generic CalDAV connector to the connector library, with iCloud as a preset, at full parity with Google and Microsoft (read, change detection, writes, RSVP, series), and plugs it into TimeTug's Accounts tab. The API contract is in `docs/calendar-connectors-api.md`; part 11 lists "No CalDAV connector yet", which this phase closes. ADR 0012 already chose CalDAV for iCloud because, unlike EventKit, it can invite and RSVP (RFC 6638 server-side scheduling).

## Goals

1. Sign in to iCloud with an Apple ID and an app-specific password, and to any other CalDAV server (Fastmail, Nextcloud, ...) with a server URL, username and password, and read their calendars and events like any other source.
2. Poll for changes cheaply with `sync-collection` (RFC 6578), falling back to `getctag`.
3. Write: create, update, delete, respond to invites, with all three recurrence scopes and attendees, through the Phase 3 `WritableCalendarSource` API.
4. Read a series' recurrence rules (`SeriesSource`).
5. Keep the library layering rule: every new target is pure Swift with no external dependencies and builds on Linux; OS-specific code stays in `CalendarApple` and the app.

## Non-goals

- No webhook or push (CalDAV has none that is portable; polling was chosen for every provider).
- No conference link generation (CalDAV has no such service). Links in events are still detected by `ConferenceDetector`.
- No VTODO (reminders lists), no VJOURNAL, no free/busy queries, no calendar sharing or creation of calendars.
- No moving events between calendars, no attachments (`ATTACH` is preserved on round-trip, not modeled).
- No server-side expansion (`<C:expand>`); expansion is client-side (see Decisions).
- No ICS subscription connector (the `ICalendar` product makes one cheap later).
- No control over scheduling emails in this phase (`controlsNotifications = false`, see Writes).

## Decisions

Made with the user during brainstorming:

- **Generic CalDAV with an iCloud preset**, one implementation. Two `ConnectorKind`s so the "+" menu shows "iCloud" and "Other CalDAV" as separate entries.
- **Full parity with Google and Microsoft in one phase.**
- **Client-side engine (approach A):** a reusable iCalendar codec, a recurrence expander in `CalendarCore`, and a WebDAV client. Rejected: server-side `<C:expand>` (uneven server support, and expanded results lose the master and rule that `SeriesSource` and splits need, so both paths would be needed); iCloud through EventKit only (not portable, no invite/RSVP).
- **`ICalendar` is its own library product**, reusable by a future ICS subscription connector and by library users.
- **Generic credential sheet** in the app, built from the kind's `[CredentialField]`, reusable by any password connector.
- **`controlsNotifications = false`** until the live test shows iCloud honors `SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT`; emailing someone when the caller asked for no email is the failure to avoid, so a write that would email someone with a policy other than `.all` is refused (the contract's general rule, as EventKit does; see Writes).
- **Delete keeps its lock.** Unlike Google and EventKit (last-writer-wins), CalDAV deletes of a single occurrence are whole-resource PUTs and must carry `If-Match`, or they would erase other occurrences' concurrent edits; see Writes.
- **Optimistic locking with real ETags:** every write is a whole-resource PUT with `If-Match`, driven by the shared `PatchMerge.apply`.

## Placement

| Package / target | New or changed |
|---|---|
| `CalendarCore` | `RecurrenceSet.occurrences(of:in:limit:)` (the expander; `RecurrenceSet`'s doc comment and API contract part 10, which say the library does no expansion, are updated), `URLSessionTransport(session:followsRedirects:)` (see Security), `CalendarService.calDAV` (one static constant), the optional `CredentialPromptHelp` protocol (see Sign-in), and `WindowsTimeZones` moved here from `MicrosoftCalendar` (see `VTIMEZONE`) |
| `CalendarConnectors` → `Sources/ICalendar` (new target and library product; depends only on `CalendarCore`) | content-line parser and writer, component tree (`ICalendarComponent`, `ICalendarProperty`), `VTIMEZONE` resolver, `VEVENT` ↔ `CalendarEvent` mapper, `VALARM` ↔ `Reminder` mapper, patch applier that edits a component tree in place |
| `CalendarConnectors` → `Sources/CalDAVCalendar` (new target and library product; depends on `CalendarCore` and `ICalendar`; `FoundationXML` on Linux) | `WebDAVClient`, `DAVXML` (multistatus parsing and request bodies), `CalDAVDiscovery`, `CalDAVConnectorKind`, `ICloudConnectorKind`, `CalDAVAccount` (shared config), `CalDAVCalendarSource` (`+Sync`, `+Write`, `+Split`, `+Series`) |
| `CalendarConnectors` → `Tests` | `ICalendarTests`, recurrence expander tests in `CalendarCoreTests`, `CalDAVCalendarTests` with an in-memory fake CalDAV server behind `FakeTransport` |
| `CalendarTestSupport` | reused as is (`WritableSourceConformance`, `AllDayConformance`, `ProvidedFieldsConformance`) |
| `CalendarApple` | iCloud live smoke test only (credentials go through the existing Keychain `CredentialStore`) |
| App (`Apps/macOS`) | `CredentialSheet` (SwiftUI), the retry loop in `AccountsController`, both kinds registered in `AppConnectors.makeRegistry`, Settings search keywords |

The two kinds share `CalDAVAccount` and `CalDAVCalendarSource`; they differ only in fields, server URL, display name and provider.

| | `ICloudConnectorKind` | `CalDAVConnectorKind` |
|---|---|---|
| id | `icloud` | `caldav` |
| display name | "iCloud" | "Other CalDAV" |
| platforms | all | all |
| authorization | `.password(fields: [appleID, appPassword(secret)])` | `.password(fields: [serverURL, username, password(secret)])` |
| server | fixed `https://caldav.icloud.com` | entered by the user |
| calendar `provider` | `.iCloud` | `.calDAV` |
| calendar `service` | `.calDAV` | `.calDAV` |

## Sign-in

- `authorize(using:credentials:)` calls `interaction.promptCredentials(fields)`, trims whitespace from non-secret fields, and runs discovery with the result. Nothing is stored until discovery succeeds.
- **Discovery:** `PROPFIND` on `<server>/.well-known/caldav` (RFC 6764), following redirects under the rules in Security; then `PROPFIND current-user-principal`; then `PROPFIND calendar-home-set` and `calendar-user-address-set` on the principal. If `.well-known` is missing (404), the server URL itself is tried as the context path. A 401 at any step is `SourceError.authExpired`.
- **Connection:** `connectionID` is a new UUID. `displayName` is the Apple ID for iCloud and `username@host` otherwise. `config` holds `serverURL`, `username` (not secret; used to prefill the sheet on reauthorize), `principalURL`, `homeURL`, `userAddresses` (the principal's `calendar-user-address-set`, newline-separated) and `autoSchedule` (`true` when the server's `DAV:` header lists `calendar-auto-schedule`), so capabilities are fixed when the source is made. The Keychain entry holds the username and the password under the keys `username` and `password`.
- **Reauthorize:** prompts again with the non-secret fields prefilled from `config` (see App wiring), runs discovery, and throws `SourceError.invalidResponse` if the principal URL differs (a different account); otherwise replaces the stored secrets and keeps the `connectionID`.
- **Help text:** kinds may adopt a small optional protocol `CredentialPromptHelp` (in `CalendarCore`: `var credentialHelp: (text: String, url: URL?)? { get }`) so the sheet can explain app-specific passwords and link to Apple's page. The iCloud kind adopts it; `AuthorizationMethod` and `CredentialField` are unchanged.

## Security

- Basic auth is sent only over HTTPS. For "Other CalDAV" an `http://` server URL is refused at sign-in, except `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` (local test servers).
- Credentials are sent only to the configured server's host or its subdomains, matched at a label boundary (`host == base || host.hasSuffix("." + base)`). iCloud moves an account to a partition host such as `pNN-caldav.icloud.com`, so iCloud's base is `icloud.com`; for other servers the base is the entered host. Only `https` is followed (or `http` to the loopback exception).
- `URLSession` follows redirects on its own, so the check above would never run. `URLSessionTransport` gains an opt-in `followsRedirects: false` (a task delegate that declines the redirect, so `send` returns the 3xx response); both CalDAV kinds build their transport with it. `WebDAVClient` then follows redirects itself (up to 5), checks each `Location` against the rule above and attaches credentials per request; a redirect or an `href` that resolves to any other host is `SourceError.invalidResponse`, never followed with the password. A Linux test proves the delegate works on swift-corelibs-foundation.
- The password is never logged. Request logs leave out the `Authorization` header; response bodies are logged only at debug level and never include request headers.

## Reads

### Calendars

`PROPFIND` depth 1 on the calendar home for `resourcetype`, `displayname`, `supported-calendar-component-set`, `current-user-privilege-set`, `calendar-timezone`, `apple:calendar-color`, `getctag`, `sync-token`, and `schedule-default-calendar-URL` on the principal.

- Kept: collections whose resource type includes `calendar` and whose component set includes `VEVENT` (a missing set means all components). Skipped: VTODO-only lists, the scheduling inbox and outbox, iCloud notification collections.
- `id`: the collection path relative to the home URL (stable across partition-host moves).
- `title` from `displayname` (falling back to the last path segment); colour from `apple:calendar-color` (`#RRGGBBAA` trimmed to `#RRGGBB`).
- `permissions`: `canEdit` = `write` or `write-content` privilege; `canViewDetails` = `read` privilege (a `read-free-busy`-only calendar is `false`); `canShare` and `canViewPrivate` are filled (`false` unless the privilege set says otherwise) so `permissionDetails` holds.
- `timeZone` from `calendar-timezone` through the `VTIMEZONE` resolver.
- `isDefault`: true for the collection named by `schedule-default-calendar-URL`, false for the rest, nil when the server does not say.
- `kind`: `.subscribed` for iCloud subscribed collections (`calendarserver:subscribed` resource type), `.standard` otherwise.
- `accountName`: the connection's display name. `service = .calDAV`; `provider` per kind.

### Events

`REPORT calendar-query` per visible calendar with a `time-range` filter on `VEVENT` over the requested interval, asking for `getetag` and `calendar-data`. One resource holds one `UID`: a master (with `RRULE`/`RDATE`/`EXDATE`, or none) plus zero or more overrides carrying `RECURRENCE-ID`. A resource with overrides but no master (an invite to single occurrences) is valid; each override is shown on its own.

**Identity**
- `seriesID` = the resource name (last path segment, e.g. `4F2A….ics`) for a recurring resource; nil otherwise. A non-recurring event has `series = .notRecurring` (never nil, since `series` is a provided field).
- `eventID` = the resource name for a non-recurring event; for an occurrence, the resource name + `#` + the original start in UTC basic format (`20260927T150000Z`; all-day: `20260927`).
- `uid` = `UID`, `uidScope = .global`, so the existing duplicate merge matches iCloud-via-CalDAV with iCloud-via-EventKit and with copies in Google or Microsoft.
- `version` = the resource ETag (shared by every occurrence of a resource; every write is a whole-resource PUT, so this is the right lock).
- `series = .occurrence(seriesID:originalStart:)` for occurrences.

**Expansion** (`RecurrenceSet.occurrences(of:in:limit:)`)
- Expands `RRULE` (every frequency and BY-part the parser accepts, `COUNT`, `UNTIL`, `WKST`, `BYSETPOS`), adds `RDATE`, removes `EXDATE`, in the master's own time zone on wall-clock time so DST shifts are correct; all-day by calendar date.
- An override replaces the occurrence whose original start equals its `RECURRENCE-ID`; an override moved into the window from outside is included because the whole resource is returned whenever any instance overlaps. The query window gets the same margin `CalendarStore` already applies.
- A hard limit (default 5000 instances per resource per query) stops runaway rules; hitting it logs once and returns what was expanded.
- A rule the parser keeps as `unparsed` cannot be expanded: the master's first occurrence and the overrides are shown, and a test pins this.

**Field mapping**

| iCalendar | `CalendarEvent` |
|---|---|
| `SUMMARY`, `DESCRIPTION`, `LOCATION` | `title`, `notes`, `location` |
| `DTSTART`/`DTEND`/`DURATION`, `VALUE=DATE` | `start`, `end`, `timeZone`, `isAllDay` (all-day through `AllDay` in the event's zone; floating times in the calendar's zone) |
| `STATUS` | `status` (a `CANCELLED` event is returned; the bridge drops it as today) |
| `TRANSP` | `availability` (`OPAQUE` busy, `TRANSPARENT` free) |
| `CLASS` | `visibility` (`PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, `CONFIDENTIAL`; absent is `.default`) |
| `ORGANIZER`, `ATTENDEE` (`CN`, `ROLE`, `PARTSTAT`, `CUTYPE`) | `organizer`, `attendees`; email through `CalendarUserAddress.email(from:)`; `isSelf` by matching the principal's `calendar-user-address-set`; `CUTYPE=RESOURCE`/`ROOM` is `.resource` |
| `VALARM` (`TRIGGER` relative or absolute, `ACTION`, `REPEAT`/`DURATION`, Apple proximity) | `reminders` (the `VALARM` reader ADR 0014 deferred to this connector); a `VALARM` with `X-APPLE-DEFAULT-ALARM:TRUE` has `isCalendarDefault = true`; no `VALARM` is `[]` |
| `URL` | `url` (`X-APPLE-STRUCTURED-LOCATION` has no event field and is kept as an unmodeled property) |
| `LAST-MODIFIED`, `CREATED` | `lastModified`, `created` |

Conference links come from the shared `ConferenceDetector` (location, URL, notes). `participation` is derived from the self attendee as the other connectors do. Calendars get `supportedAvailabilities = [.busy, .free]` (all `TRANSP` can say).

**Provided fields:** `visibility`, `availability`, `reminders`, `series`, `participation`, `version`, `uidScope`, `recurrenceRules`, `permissionDetails`, `provider`, `calendarTimeZone`. `lastModified` and `created` are declared only if the live test shows iCloud always sends them; `ProvidedFieldsConformance` checks whatever is declared. `isDefault` is not declared (servers may not say). `supportedAvailabilities` is declared. When the account has no `userAddresses`, `isSelf` is never true, so `participation` is not declared for that source.

### `VTIMEZONE`

A `TZID` that `TimeZone(identifier:)` knows is used directly. Otherwise the resolver maps known Windows and Outlook names (through `WindowsTimeZones`, moved from `MicrosoftCalendar` to `CalendarCore` so both connectors share it) and, failing that, matches the component's `STANDARD`/`DAYLIGHT` offsets and rules against the system zones for the event's year; the last fallback is a fixed-offset zone from the `STANDARD` offset. Writes always emit IANA `TZID`s with a `VTIMEZONE` (RFC 4791 requires one per `TZID` used) whose `STANDARD`/`DAYLIGHT` observances are enumerated with `TimeZone.nextDaylightSavingTimeTransition(after:)` from one year before the event's start through the series' end, or 20 years for an open-ended series, so clients that resolve through the `VTIMEZONE` get the right offsets for every occurrence. A `core-linux` test checks the transition API on swift-corelibs-foundation.

## Change detection

`CalDAVCalendarSource` is a `PollingCalendarSource`, polled at the same interval as the other connectors.

1. `PROPFIND` depth 1 on the home for `getctag` and `sync-token`. A calendar added or removed (or a changed display property) returns `.calendarsChanged`.
2. For each calendar whose token or ctag changed, `REPORT sync-collection` (RFC 6578) from its stored token (kept in `SyncStateStore` under scope `calendar:<id>`); any change returns `.eventsChanged(calendarIDs:)`.
3. An invalid token (the `valid-sync-token` precondition, 403 or 409) re-baselines that calendar and reports it changed.
4. A server that does not support `sync-collection` (no `sync-token` property) falls back to the ctag alone.
5. The first call establishes the baseline and returns nil. A 401 is `.authExpired` and finishes the `changes()` stream with `.sourceFailed`.

## Series

`series(id:calendarID:)` GETs the resource and returns the master's `RRULE`, `RDATE` and `EXDATE` as `CalendarSeries` (through `RecurrenceSet(iCalendarLines:timeZone:isAllDay:)`). An unknown id or a resource without a recurring master throws `SourceError.notFound`.

## Writes

`CalDAVCalendarSource` is a `WritableCalendarSource` and a `SeriesSource`.

**Capabilities**
- `canWrite = true`. With `autoSchedule` (iCloud has it): `canEditAttendees` and `canRespondToInvite` are true and `writableFields` includes `.attendees`. Without it, both are false and `.attendees` is left out, so `canEditAttendees == writableFields.contains(.attendees)` always holds (without server scheduling, attendees written would never be invited).
- `writableFields`: title, notes, location, timing, availability, visibility, reminders, recurrence, and attendees as above. `conference` is not writable; `ConferenceRequest.generate` or `ConferenceChange.generate` throws `WriteError.unsupported([.conference])`. `ConferenceChange.remove` is also unsupported (links live in free text).
- `recurrenceScopes`: all three. `controlsNotifications = false`.
- Reminders accepted: start- or end-relative and absolute triggers with a display alert (sound where the model has one). Anything else throws `.unsupported([.reminders])` before any request. A draft's `nil` reminders (the calendar's defaults) writes no `VALARM`; `[]` writes none either. `.clear` on a patch (the calendar's defaults) cannot be expressed and throws `.unsupported([.reminders])`, as for Microsoft.

**Mechanics.** Updates and responses run through `PatchMerge.apply(patch:version:maxAttempts:fetchCurrent:write:)` with the default 3 attempts and `ref.version` as the version. `write` GETs the resource (skipped on the first attempt when the caller's version is the ETag of the copy just read), applies the patch to the freshly parsed component tree, and PUTs the whole resource with `If-Match: <etag>`; a 412 returns `.stale`. `fetchCurrent` re-reads the resource and returns the event the patch is judged against: for `.thisInstance` and `respond` the occurrence at `ref.originalStart` (expanded from the fresh resource), otherwise the series master in its read form; an occurrence or resource that is gone throws `WriteError.notFound`. One ETag covers every occurrence, so a concurrent edit to another occurrence makes the PUT stale but `PatchMerge` finds no overlap and the patch is re-applied to the fresh tree. Properties the model does not cover (`X-` properties, `ATTACH`, Apple-specific ones, unknown parameters) are kept as they were. 403 is `WriteError.forbidden`, 404/410 `WriteError.notFound`, 507 `SourceError.server(status:)`.

**What writes return.** As for Google: `create` with a recurrence and the series-wide writes (`.allInSeries`, a `.thisAndFollowing` at the first occurrence, the new series of a split) return the series master with `seriesID` set to its own id and `originalStart` to its start, so a `.thisInstance` update, delete or respond on `EventRef(returned)` throws `WriteError.invalid("this is a recurring series; use .allInSeries or read the occurrence first")` before any request. Single-occurrence writes return that occurrence. The returned `version` is the ETag from the PUT response; if the server sends none (or the live test shows it rewrites bodies), the connector GETs the resource once.

**A ref without `originalStart`.** `.thisInstance` and `.thisAndFollowing` (updates, deletes and responses) throw `WriteError.invalid("needs the occurrence's original start")`; `.allInSeries` needs it only for a timing change, which throws `.unsupported(fields: [.timing])` without it (the start delta cannot be known).

**create** PUTs `<calendar>/<new UUID>.ics` with `If-None-Match: *`, using the draft's `uid` or a new UUID. If the draft has a `uid`, a `calendar-query` with a `UID` text-match filter runs first; a hit throws `WriteError.alreadyExists(stored)` and writes nothing. A 412 on the PUT (a name clash) retries once with a new name. Returns the event read back from the response ETag and the written body.

**update**
- `thisInstance`: adds an override `VEVENT` with `RECURRENCE-ID` equal to the original start (copying the master's properties), or edits the existing override.
- `allInSeries`: edits the master. When the patch moves the series start by a delta, each override's `RECURRENCE-ID` and each `EXDATE` shift by the same delta so they keep matching; an override whose own time had been changed keeps its time. When the patch changes the rule, overrides and `EXDATE`s that no longer match an occurrence of the new rule are dropped.
- `thisAndFollowing` (split): (1) PUT the original resource (`If-Match` its ETag) with the master's rule truncated just before the split occurrence, and overrides and `EXDATE`s at or after it removed; (2) PUT a new resource with a new UID starting at the split occurrence with the patch applied, carrying the removed overrides and `EXDATE`s (re-stamped with the new `UID`, and shifted if the start moved). Unlike Google, later exceptions move with the new series because they live in the same resource.
  - **Rule arithmetic.** An `UNTIL` rule keeps its `UNTIL` on the new series and gets a new `UNTIL` one second (all-day: one day) before the split slot on the old one. A `COUNT` rule never gets `UNTIL` added (`COUNT` with `UNTIL` is invalid): the expander counts the rule's generated instances before the split slot (EXDATE'd ones included, as RFC 5545 counts them), the old master keeps `COUNT=n`, and the new series gets `COUNT=original-n`. The whole resource is at hand, so the counts are exact (unlike Graph, where they can be short). An open-ended rule stays open on the new series.
  - **Restore.** If step 2 fails after step 1, the connector PUTs the original body back with `If-Match` set to the ETag step 1 returned (unconditionally with respect to cancellation, so a cancelled caller still gets the restore) and rethrows the original error. A 412 on the restore means someone edited the truncated series meanwhile: it is not overwritten, and the result is `WriteError.partial` naming both errors, as is any other restore failure.
  - Splitting on the first occurrence is an `allInSeries` update.

**delete**
- `thisInstance`: adds an `EXDATE` for the original start and removes any override for it.
- `thisAndFollowing`: truncates the rule with the arithmetic above and removes later overrides and `EXDATE`s; on the first occurrence it is `allInSeries`.
- Both are whole-resource PUTs with `If-Match` (the current ETag, not `ref.version`, so a caller's old version does not block them). On 412 the connector re-reads and re-applies the change, which is idempotent and touches no other occurrence, up to 3 attempts, then throws `WriteError.conflict(fields: [.recurrence])`.
- `allInSeries` (or a non-recurring event): `DELETE` without `If-Match`, last-writer-wins like the other connectors' deletes.

**respond** sets our own `ATTENDEE`'s `PARTSTAT` (matched by `calendar-user-address-set`) on the master for `allInSeries`, and on a new or existing override for `thisInstance`; then PUTs. `thisAndFollowing` throws `WriteError.unsupported(fields: [.attendees])`, as for Microsoft: an attendee cannot split the organizer's series (a new UID would be unknown to the organizer). The server sends the iTIP `REPLY` (RFC 6638 implicit scheduling). `.needsAction` throws `WriteError.invalid`. No self attendee throws `WriteError.unsupported([.attendees])`.

**Notifications.** With implicit scheduling the server emails attendees on every organizer change and the organizer on every reply, and this connector cannot stop it (`controlsNotifications = false`). Following the contract's rule, `NotifyPolicy` other than `.all` is accepted only when nobody else would be told: a create, update or delete of an event with attendees other than the owner, and every `respond` (the organizer gets the reply), throws `WriteError.unsupported(fields: [.attendees])` before any request when the policy is `.none` or `.externalOnly`. This differs from Microsoft, which accepts and ignores the policy; API contract part 13 says so. The live smoke test records whether iCloud honors `SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT`; if it does, a later change can honor `.none` and flip the capability.

## App wiring

- `AppConnectors.makeRegistry` always registers `ICloudConnectorKind` and `CalDAVConnectorKind` (no client id, so no CI secret and no local configuration).
- `CredentialSheet` (new SwiftUI view) renders one `TextField` per non-secret field and one `SecureField` per secret field, with the kind's `CredentialPromptHelp` text and link below, and Cancel / Sign In. Sign In is disabled while any field is empty. Cancel throws `CancellationError` from `promptCredentials`.
- `AccountsController` supplies the `promptCredentials` closure to `LoopbackAuthorizationInteraction` and presents the sheet. On a sign-in failure other than cancellation it runs `authorize` again with the non-secret fields prefilled and the error shown at the top of the sheet ("Apple ID or app-specific password was not accepted." for `.authExpired`; the described error otherwise). The retry loop is app-only; the library contract does not change.
- `SettingsSearch` keywords gain "caldav", "fastmail", "nextcloud" ("icloud" is already there).

## Prerequisites (the user)

- For the live smoke test: an iCloud app-specific password (appleid.apple.com → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords) in the git-ignored `~/.config/timetug/icloud-live` (two lines, Apple ID then password), and a test calendar in that account named `TimeTug Live Test`.

## Testing

1. **`ICalendar`:** round-trip fixtures (RFC 5545 examples and scrubbed iCloud exports) preserve unknown properties and parameters; line folding at 75 octets including multi-byte characters; text escaping; `VTIMEZONE` resolution (IANA, Windows names, rule matching, fixed-offset fallback); `VALARM` reader and writer round-trip (ADR 0014's pending test); `VEVENT` ↔ `CalendarEvent` mapping for every row of the table above.
2. **Expander (`CalendarCoreTests`):** every example in RFC 5545 section 3.8.5.3; DST forward and back for a daily 01:30 and 02:30 rule; all-day; `RDATE`/`EXDATE`; `COUNT` with a window starting mid-series; the instance limit; the unparsed fallback.
3. **`CalDAVCalendarTests`:** an in-memory fake CalDAV server behind `FakeTransport` (PROPFIND, `calendar-query`, `sync-collection`, GET, PUT with `If-Match`/`If-None-Match`, DELETE, ETags, sync tokens, injectable 401/403/412/507). `WritableSourceConformance`, `AllDayConformance` and `ProvidedFieldsConformance` run against it. Request-shape and parsing tests use recorded iCloud multistatus XML. Discovery tests cover `.well-known` redirects, a partition host, and a redirect to a foreign host (refused). Split (`UNTIL`, `COUNT` and open-ended rules, with overrides and `EXDATE`s on both sides), restore-on-failure, a stale restore and `.partial` are covered with injected failures, as are `PatchMerge` retries where another occurrence changed (retry succeeds) and where the same occurrence changed (conflict), notify-policy refusals, and the capability invariant with and without `calendar-auto-schedule`. `URLSessionTransport(followsRedirects: false)` has its own test against a local server.
4. **Linux:** the `core-linux` job builds and tests `ICalendar` and `CalDAVCalendar` (proves `FoundationXML` works).
5. **Live (opt-in, never in CI):** `TIMETUG_LIVE_ICLOUD=1 swift test --package-path Packages/CalendarApple --filter iCloud` signs in with `~/.config/timetug/icloud-live`, never prints the credentials, and prints `LIVE` lines to paste into "Live findings".

## Risks (verify in the live test)

- `sync-collection` on iCloud: supported, and how an invalid token is reported.
- Whether iCloud always sends `LAST-MODIFIED` and `CREATED` (decides the provided fields).
- Whether iCloud honors `SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT` (decides a future `controlsNotifications`).
- The partition host and redirect chain from `caldav.icloud.com`.
- How subscribed calendars appear (resource type, privileges).
- How iCloud treats the split: the truncated master and the new resource both show correctly in Calendar.app, and moved overrides survive.
- Whether iCloud rewrites the body on PUT (so the ETag in the response is not the body we sent); if so, writes read back with a GET.

## Manual checklist (the user, in the app, with the real account)

- [ ] Settings > Accounts > + shows "iCloud" and "Other CalDAV".
- [ ] iCloud sign-in with a wrong password reopens the sheet with the Apple ID kept and the error shown; with an app-specific password it adds the account and lists its calendars (reminders lists absent).
- [ ] An iCloud meeting also visible through Apple Calendar appears once in the popup (merged by UID).
- [ ] An event added in Calendar.app on iCloud appears in TimeTug within one poll.
- [ ] Revoking the app-specific password shows "Sign in again"; signing in again keeps the calendar choices.
- [ ] Removing the account removes its Keychain item.
- [ ] The credential sheet's layout (fields, error line, help text and link, Cancel and Sign In) looks right; it was not checked in the GUI.
- [ ] A wrong password followed at once by the right one (a rapid retry) signs in without a stuck or doubled sheet; this was not checked in the GUI.

## As built

Differences from the design above:

- The iCloud live smoke test is in `CalDAVCalendarTests` (`iCloudLiveSmoke`), not `CalendarApple`: it needs no Apple-only
  code and uses the source's internals for raw probes. Run it with
  `TIMETUG_LIVE_ICLOUD=1 swift test --package-path Packages/CalendarConnectors --filter iCloudLiveSmoke`.
- `URLSessionTransport(configuration:followsRedirects:)` instead of `(session:followsRedirects:)` (a session's delegate
  is fixed when it is made).
- `CredentialPromptHelp.credentialHelp` is a `CredentialHelp` struct (`text`, `linkTitle`, `url`) instead of a tuple.
- `FakeCalDAVServer` is its own `HTTPTransport`, not built on `FakeTransport` (it keeps resources, ETags and sync tokens).
- `series(id:)` reads the master through `EventReader` and its time zone resolver, not
  `RecurrenceSet(iCalendarLines:)`, so non-IANA `TZID`s resolve the same way as in reads.
- A patch is compared (`PatchMerge`) with the occurrence at `originalStart` whenever the ref has one, else the master.
- The "Other CalDAV" display name is the user name alone when it already contains "@".
- `canRespondToInvite` also needs `userAddresses` (without them the account's attendee entry cannot be found).
- Changing a series between all-day and timed while it has changed occurrences throws `unsupported([.timing])`.
- The architecture check (`scripts/ci/check-architecture.sh`) now allows `FoundationXML` in the connector library.
- The connector reads a `STATUS:CANCELLED` component with `status == .cancelled` and does not drop it; `CalendarBridge`
  drops cancelled events, as for the other connectors.

Known limitations:

- A whole-series edit changes only the master resource. An occurrence that has its own override keeps its own values and
  attendees.
- Moving a timed series from one occurrence shifts it by absolute seconds (`seriesTiming`, `SeriesEditor.shift`), so
  across a DST change the local wall-clock time can differ by an hour from the one the caller chose.
- A weak ETag always fails `If-Match` (412), so writes to a server that sends only weak ETags never succeed. A
  duplicate-UID creation race (the server's `no-uid-conflict` answer, 403) surfaces as a forbidden error.
- The `sync-collection` REPORT is sent with `Depth: 1`; RFC 6578 says `Depth: 0`. To be verified in the live iCloud run.
- Splitting a series (`.thisAndFollowing`): a 429 or 503 on the write that truncates the original is treated as a certain
  refusal (nothing was applied). An account with no known own addresses cannot split a series it organizes, and an
  account that is only an attendee cannot split (both throw `unsupported([.attendees])`). Switching between all-day and
  timed during a split is refused when the series has overrides or exclusions. When the state after an unclear failure
  cannot be established, or was changed by other clients, the result is `WriteError.partial` and the user must check the
  calendar.
- The app's own writes come back as `eventsChanged` on the next poll.
- A resource of several overrides and no master: `readBack` returns the first occurrence when `originalStart` is unknown.
- `FakeCalDAVServer` is less strict than a real server: the first `sync-collection` with an empty token reports
  tombstones, every `REPORT` that is not a sync is treated as a `calendar-query`, the UID match assumes CRLF line ends,
  and `If-Match: *` is not treated as a wildcard.
- On Linux the two `URLProtocol` redirect tests in `CalendarCoreTests/TransportRedirectTests.swift` are skipped:
  swift-corelibs-foundation traps when a custom `URLProtocol` reports a redirect. They run on macOS. The refusal of real
  HTTP redirects by `URLSessionTransport(followsRedirects: false)` is therefore untested on Linux. TimeTug ships on macOS
  only, and the Linux CI job is a portability check.
- The credential sheet layout and a rapid wrong-then-right sign-in retry were not verified in the GUI (see the manual
  checklist).
